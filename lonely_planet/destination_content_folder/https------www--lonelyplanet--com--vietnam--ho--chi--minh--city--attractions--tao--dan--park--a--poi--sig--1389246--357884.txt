It’s fascinating to visit in the early morning and late afternoon when thousands of locals exercise. The city’s bird lovers (mainly elderly gentlemen) also flock here, cages in hand, to what is universally known as the bird cafe.
The park is split down the middle by Ð Truong Dinh. To the northeast of Ð Truong Dinh is a small contemporary sculpture garden and the old Cercle Sportif, an elite sporting club during the French-colonial period and now the Labour Culture Palace with tennis courts, a colonnaded art-deco swimming pool and a clubhouse.Read moreContactAddressÐ Nguyen Thi Minh KhaiSuggest an edit to this attractionLonely Planet's must-see attractionsWar Remnants Museum0.29 MILESTo understand the US invasion of Vietnam, and contextualize its devastating impact on the country's civilians, this remarkable and deeply moving museum is…Jade Emperor Pagoda1.2 MILESBuilt in 1909 in honour of the supreme Taoist god (the Jade Emperor or King of Heaven, Ngoc Hoang), this is one of the most atmospheric temples in Ho Chi…Notre Dame Cathedral0.59 MILESBuilt between 1877 and 1883, Notre Dame Cathedral enlivens the heart of Ho Chi Minh City's government quarter, facing Ð Dong Khoi.
