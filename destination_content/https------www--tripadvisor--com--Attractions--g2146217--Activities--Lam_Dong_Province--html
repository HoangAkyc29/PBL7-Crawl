5. Valley of Love
462
Just as true love has to surpass several obstacles, the Valley of Love in Dalat had to surpass many challenges in the past in order to gain its rightful name today. In the beginning, the valley was called Vallée D’amour (Valley of Love) by the French before being renamed The Valley of Piece. In 1935, its beauty and captivation persuaded people to once again name it after the most wonderful thing in the world: Love. Thanks to being the honeymoon destination of newly-married couples, this valley is even regarded as Niagara Fall of Vietnam. The Valley of Love today is located 4 miles away from the center of Dalat, the little Paris, on Phu Dong Thien Vuong St.

Third eye power
Just a 15 minute motorbike ride from Dalat lake this pagoda will fascinate your imagination for hours if you take your time to explore the essence of the temple, pagoda, and elements around, especially the furniture, crafts, rock shop adjacent and the Buddhist monestery on the hill above. Soak it in and allow your imagination's celebration in this spiritual awakening.

Rollercoaster fun
The waterfall is not so special and a bit smelly. But the rollercoaster was really fun! We loved that, it's kinda pricey but worth it.

Interesting site with beautiful grounds.
We visited the monastery after taking the cable car from town. There are beautiful gardens and shrines and statuary to see. If you want to enter the temples you must have your shoulders and knees covered, so dress appropriately or bring a wrap (men too).

Recommend!
Pleased we visited! Lovely day so lovely views. The areas to the left of the map were good but some areas seemed to be in building works, areas to the right were beautiful - gorgeous flowers and models of wonders of the world, amazing gardens and statues and nice to walk around. Can comfortably walk the whole thing but buggies available and regular if prefer not to! We easily spent three hours here. Would recommend!

Asian crowder market. Nothing special
Regular crowded and overpriced local market. If you are for the first time here in Asia. It will be great experience. Otherwise I recommend you to avoid such touristy and pricy parts of the city

Bring your running shoes
Great lake for a run with a path that runs alongside the road. It would be a decent 30 to 40 minutes around the lake. Alternatively you can opt for horse and cart, open taxi, paddle boats in the lake or grab a coffee and food at many of the lakeside cafes and restaurants. It is well maintained but I wouldn't swim in it, we saw about 10 dead fish floating on top of the water, not a great sign

A delightful garden in which to spend an hour.
A peaceful, beautiful park, with lovely sets of flower arrangements, soothing background music,
a hothouse, with many varieties of roses.
It is directly adjacent to the lake, about a 30 minute walk from central Dalat.

Good view is possible for 30000 Vnd at a coffee place
Today (13 may 2023) we went by cab from Da Lat (near Lâm Vien Square) for 650000 Vnd return price (was less than Grab price at the time).

When we got to Thac Voi, the cab parked at the parking lot next to the giant lady Buddha (Linh An). Almost immediately a woman came to us saying the waterfall was closed and that she has a cafe across the waterfall with view over the whole fall. She gave us a folder of her cafe. The view could be nice from her cafe but it would be from a too far distance. We wanted to try to get as close to the waterfall. Glad we tried eventually. We tried 3 ways. The best and safest way was via a cafe called Elephant coffee, which was at walking distance from the lady buddha. Get out the parking lot and go to the right, walk to the crossing and cross the bridge where the water streams towards the waterfall. At the right hand is the cafe Elephant coffee. Here you pay 30000 Vnd to get a very nice view. There were 2 levels you can see the waterfall from, one right after the stairs from the top and one through a more muddy rocky path a level down. Both are well worth it! The pictures are from these 2 levels.
The other routes we tried was going down from the big lady Buddha which led through high and sharp-ish grass and eventually to a fence with a hole in it on the right side of the fence. We didn't go through cause the gap was a bit small and not sure what you can see at the other side.
The other route was just around the corner of the original entry (with a gate with the sign that it is 'temporarily' closed). Here are a few shops and a red old-ish building at the very end. Some shop vendor will come to you and ask you for 50000 VND per person. We were curious so we paid it, but eventually were not glad we did. It all looked very unsafe, super rusty, slippery and a lot of trash. Not strange cause this route is the 'illegal' way to get behind the gate which is supposed to be temporarily closed. So of course there is no maintenance done. When we got to the end of this route, there was a huge rock in front of the view of the waterfall. Did not look safe to climb the rocks there, so only saw the upper side half of the waterfall. All in all, we would recommend to save yourself some time and energy and go via the elephant coffee where you pay a smaller fee for a safe route and better view.
Hope this helps and enjoy!

It was okay. Glad I went but not sure I’d go again if I went back again but maybe. Coffee place was great. Stands were good. Bought some wood whistles that the engraved names on plus necklaces were she wrote names on rice and put inside what ever you picked out. Very cheap souvenirs.

Pagoda of Chinese people.
The pagoda is large and very beautiful. The pagoda is located high and very nice. At the gate of the pagoda there is a very large cherry blossom tree. Inside the pagoda, we are overwhelmed by the big golden Buddha Statue.
