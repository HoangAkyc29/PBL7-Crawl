Highly recommended Tour Guide Mr Ben
I brought my dad (with knee cap problem) and a hearing impaired brother to Halong Bay. My tour guide Mr Ben was very caring, noted on my dad n bro special needs. He is professional and humourous. Mr Ben is friendly and helpful. He steered the tour with great knowledge and made the trip comfortable and memorable. We enjoyed ourselves during our full day Halong Bay day trip.

Great clean Cruise with comfortable cabin and friendly staff
The cruise itself is very good. The boat is clean spacious and not crowded. It‚Äôs worth soending the little higher fare . Also we took the limousine service for pickup from Hanoi that was very comfortable. The guide we got in n the Limousine was a bit loud and was always talking about tips. However the other gentleman on the cruise Ken was a jolly guy and conducted the tour very well. The company took enough care to give us plenty vegetarian options in the food including Veg Spring rolls Veg Pulav Noodles Salad Fruit Dessert to make it a hearty meal. The three standard Islands were covered along with Bamboo boat . We did not do kayaking. But one needs to tip the bamboo boat pilot. Overall amazing experience that ended with a cold beer and fritters and a beautiful sunset.

go if you can.
What a brilliant trip. Although it cost a lot of $ it was the trip of a lifetime . We went on Ponant expedition cruise from Dunedin in NZ for a 21 day cruise visiting many subantarctic islands ( including Macquarie Island ) and the Ross sea. We had plenty of landings on zodiacs to places such as Shackletons Hut and
Scotts Hut and lots of places to see wildlife ( penguins galore, elephant seals, birdlife but also mega herbs). The Naturalists on board were brilliant and made the trip . Very comfortable ship ( Le Soleil ) with only 180 passengers . Its a must if you can manage it

Impressive Tour - Halong and NinhBinh
The tour was flawlessly organized, with a well-thought itinerary that allowed us to savor every moment without feeling rushed. Our knowledgeable guide shared insightful stories about the history, culture, and traditions of Vietnam, adding depth to our exploration.
From comfortable and seamless tranportation to delectable local cuisine, every aspect of the tour exceeded our expectations. The tour operators demonstrated a commitment to great hospitality and responsible tourism.

Nice experience
Very nice experience, we did the plancton tour in the night. Ryan is a very nice and good English speaking tour guide. We get a lot of information and we saw much glowing plancton. We can recommend this tour. Just book it in Cat Ba in the office near the coast.
