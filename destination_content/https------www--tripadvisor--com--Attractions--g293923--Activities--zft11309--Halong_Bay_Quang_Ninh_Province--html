Although Las Vegas has solidified its status as the ultimate bachelor party destination, the city also deserves a nod for its more sophisticated side that caters to ladies who prefer Champagne and caviar over jello shots. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a tranquil spa retreat, a world-class meal, or a first class bash, here is your guide to luxurious bachelorette experiences that still scream, ‚ÄúVegas, baby!‚Äù

Awesome crew and boat
Highly recommend this ship and cruise. Small ship (only 8 cabins) but they keep you entertained! There is a cooking class, squid fishing, royal dinner, excursions to a cave and river rafting or kayaking. The staff are amazing and the food is 5 star. If you are looking for an amazing cruise, this is it! Note: we did the one night cruise.

Our Small Group Tour Felt like a Private Tour
We were keen to see Halong Bay but didn‚Äôt want an overnight tour or a long day tour.
This tour was perfect for us. We found it through Alex at Nom Nom travel, and even though we made a last minute decision to go, he took care of all the booking details at a great price.
The tour is worth the extra cost, over cheaper day tour options we saw, simply because you bypass all the long lines of the big group tours and skip past most of the souvenir shops. Our guide, Justin was friendly and helpful, happily answering our 100 questions. The boat itself comfortable and the crew of 3 did a great job, and we got to see a few spots the big boats don‚Äôt get into.
The lunch we were served on board was delicious, including fresh seafood and a big number of dishes. Only extras to pay for were drinks and tips (optional, but well deserved üòä).
We were picked up by limousine van at 8:45 and back at our hotel at 18:45 , so for us, this was a perfect day trip excursion. Just the right amount of time out on the water and no waiting around anywhere.

Amazing Ha Long Bay experience!
Ambassador Cruise great experience, Camille and Jad provided Gold standard customer service. We highly recommend this cruise! We choose the Western Style and it was a really good food. The Heritage experience is worth it! Will come back sooner.

Amazing experience! Wished we stayed longer
We had an amazing time. The staff were so lovely and helpful. Especially Linh Chi, she was very attentive in serving us and taking great group photos - we really appreciate it. Bruce Panda was very informative on our small boat rides to the cruise and activities.

Exotic cruise and a beautiful place to stay. Hallong Bay is itself a beautiful place with rich natural beauty. Cruise had made the trip even more exotic and luxurious.
Thanks to Travellia from CCU India, for arranging the same.
We stayed only for 1 night but atleast a 2night stay was required.
Food displayed was super tasty. Drinks served were also excellent.

Memorable trip to Hanoi, Hue and Da Nang
This is my second time to Hanoi and i am so happy that Phong is my tour guide again! Our trip covers Hanoi, Hue and Da Nang. Phong swiftly arranged everything for our 7D6N stay. We did not have to worry about a thing.

We especially love the street food tour, learning more from Phong as he shares his knowledge/ Stories of Vietnam and local food over many tasty food enjoyed by the locals in hidden alleys and trying the egg coffee and also covering the tourist attractions like St.Jospeh's Cathedral.
The hotel we stayed in Old Quarters is in a good location and comfortable. In addition, prices are reasonable and fair. Everything he does is outstanding as he customised our needs and enquires to what i wants. Tour guides all combined to make this trip a very memorable and fun for our family.
We will definitely keep in touch with Phong and come back again.

Exceptional Lazalee Cruises - Haylong Bay
I just wanted to put into writing the marvellous experience I had with this company. Although it was just a day trip around Halong Bay, what a day. The boat was just the right size, the food was exceptional, but above all Ruby was the start of the show. I was the only English speaking passenger, but Ruby made me feel as I was the only passenger on board. She may be small in stature, but she is a giant when looking after he clients, what a wonderful advert for the company. Thank you so much Ruby!

Paradise on La Casta Cruise
We were incredibly lucky to have the VIP suite on our trip. Our room included a whirlpool bath and our very own sauna.
The food was divine. Especially the evening meal, which was enjoyed with some wonderful cocktails.
We used our time to thoroughly relax on board, but others did go on the canoes and reported to have enjoyed their experience.

Extraordinary experience
We had an extraordinary experience on Heritage Cruise for 2 days and 1 night. The foods are beautiful, especially the fusion and surprised birthday cake at dinner. We love the architecture of the cruise, which bases on the historical character. Regarding my boyfriend, as an architect, he felt so surprised the plan of the cruise.
We also had very unforgettable experience with the staffs here, especially the manager who looks like president Obama =))). Love to experience and meet all people here.
