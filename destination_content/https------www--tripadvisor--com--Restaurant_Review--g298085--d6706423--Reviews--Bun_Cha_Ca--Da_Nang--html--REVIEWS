Fishcake noodle
I expected more if I heard “Bun Cha”, but this Bun Cha is different. Because it’s grilled fishcake noodle.
I thought all Bun Cha will be the same like my first meal in Vietnam. 
This Bun Cha, has a special broth. They cooked it with various kinds of vegetables such as pumpkin, cabbage, pineapple, tomato and dried bamboo shoots.
I like my first meal Bun Cha more than this Bun Cha, to be honest.
However, this bun cha is also worth to try, because is one of the signature dishes of Da Nang Cuisine.

Cheap and delicious
I tried it on the last day of my vacation in Da nang. It made of fishcake, lean pork, noodles, tomatoes, some vegetables and spices. Its taste is great and I was very yummy. I wish I could know it earlier day of my trips. What a pity

Best bun cha ca in Da Nang
This was my first stop once I arrived in Da Nang. For VND25,000 (small bowl), the soup, noodles and fishcake were very filling and satisfying. Fuss-free, fast service. Highly recommended!

Da Nang's speciality
The dish bun cha ca is one of Da Nang's specialities - tomato, pineapple, cabbage and bamboo in broth, with little fishcakes floating around alongside the noodles. Bun Cha Ca only serves this, and is very much a locals restaurant - probably why it costs 25,000 dong for a small bowl (85p) or 30,000 dong for a large bowl (£1).
I didn't like the flavours, but my boyfriend did - at 85p for lunch though, it didn't really matter, and I grabbed something else back at our hotel.

underwhelming
the noodles do not taste as good as it sounds. (only because we have had much better versions of this dish elsewhere in Da Nang - the one opposite the train station!) also not very clean for western standards but an authentic shop no least!

Bun Cha Ca - Delicious and Cheap
Found this restaurant while looking for another restaurant in Da Nang. It has a good price and good authentic Viet Nam Central region food. We were also mistaken the Bun Cha Ca with Ha Noi Bun Cha. This is a different kind of fish made up fish ham/paste with fish broth, and it is very famous to the local. The food was good, and the prices were cheap/reasonable. The restaurant services were friendly and very local, and it was average for clean. It is a regular local restaurant, and so do not expect a 5 stars restaurant. You have to share a long table with someone else, and there is always crowded in the morning. We went there twice for the food, and it is recommended for those travel to Da Nang. About 7 minutes from the Dragon Bridge, and about 5 minutes to Han Market.

Best broth, so-so service that lessens the good impression and experience
After having mistakenly eaten at Bun Cha Hon, I finally found 109. Fish broth was amazingly flavorful, and required no mam or lime, only garlic chili paste maybe ;) fish cakes tasty and rather soft, pickled shallots yummy, a couple slices of pineapple but veggie plate bore only lettuce and soybean sprouts, not a single herb. Service Not particularly kind or welcoming esp compared to Hon, felt neglected and sneered at from A to Z, not that I need that but it mitigates the experience. Price 25k vnd for small bowl, 30k for large.

crazy food very delicious
Its famous for both local people and foreigners. The place is not large so its maybe full if you come here at lunch time or dinner time. The fish ball was delicious, the soup was good too. Although It is not much clean but for that price I think its enough

Super cheap, voluptuous fish soup with unique local experience
Very hearty dish but not so heavy, Bun Cha Ca is a must when you visit Da Nang. The fish cakes and fish seem fresh. Super cheap and great value for both the money and the local experience. It's a dish you can enjoy anytime of the day. We came for a late lunch, early dinner but it can be good for breakfast too.

You can't get any cheaper than this...
If you are looking for a local fish balls/cakes noodles soup.
35,000VND or US $1.35 for large bowl. That's all they served here and the place had plenty of customers floating in and out while we were there, a good sign.
Not a sparkling clean place not high end, but for a cheap bowl of bun cha ca you can't go wrong.
