Awesome crew and boat
Highly recommend this ship and cruise. Small ship (only 8 cabins) but they keep you entertained! There is a cooking class, squid fishing, royal dinner, excursions to a cave and river rafting or kayaking. The staff are amazing and the food is 5 star. If you are looking for an amazing cruise, this is it! Note: we did the one night cruise.

Fabulous experience in Halong Bay.
We have done both the 3 day Halong Bay cruise with Indochina Junk (2016) & the 1 night cruise ( March 2024) and both have been excellent. We have chosen the smaller boats both times and it has been a lovely experience. The cabins were small but lovely and the food and experiences excellent. We loved the Kayaking particularly. Both trips were very well organised & the arrangements all worked well. The company goes to the much less touristy Bai Tu bay which is so much quieter & very beautiful

"Exquisite Adventure: Alisa Premier Cruise in Ha Long Bay"
My journey aboard the Alisa Premier Cruise in Ha Long Bay was extraordinary. The ship was impeccable, and the staff were exceptionally attentive. Exploring Ha Long Bay's mesmerizing scenery and partaking in activities like kayaking and cave visits was a highlight. The onboard dining surpassed expectations, offering a delectable array of Vietnamese and international cuisine. Luxurious amenities like the spa and jacuzzi added to the indulgence. Overall, the Alisa Premier Cruise provided an unforgettable experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium Ha Long Bay adventure. Massive thanks to the wonderful crew for their exceptional service.

Exceptional Lazalee Cruises - Haylong Bay
I just wanted to put into writing the marvellous experience I had with this company. Although it was just a day trip around Halong Bay, what a day. The boat was just the right size, the food was exceptional, but above all Ruby was the start of the show. I was the only English speaking passenger, but Ruby made me feel as I was the only passenger on board. She may be small in stature, but she is a giant when looking after he clients, what a wonderful advert for the company. Thank you so much Ruby!

Great trip
Great trip from the moment you step on the boat and the staff provides you with hot towels.

The boat is gorgeous and spotlessly clean all around. Hot water & cable tv.
The food very good and abundant. Not having plastic bottles is commendable too to avoid pollution .
All the staff is properly trained and I’m thankful for them changing our sheets in the eve I f after our child had an “accident “ :)
The activities are fun and not slow & petulant. The bike tour of the village for instance, punchy & gorgeous as was the Mrng Kayaking. Temperature in December is heavenly as “cold” for SE Asia standards.
Shot out too to the excellent manager, a former combat medic as well.
Highly recommended.

EXCEPTIONAL!
Wow we have just disembarked off the Emperor Cruise after the most wonderful 24 hours. What a beautiful boat! The food was absolutely exceptional! The most delicious flavours and beautifully presented. A really charming and comfortable cabin with glorious views in which to sleep and relax in when there was free time. Extremely well organised tours and activities, included a fun spring roll cookery class and an extremely interesting visit to a pearl farm. I also learnt some Vovinam moves on the sun deck!
Lastly to Dat and the rest of the brilliant team that looked after us, thank you so much we loved every minute!

Excellent boat trip
Our tour guide Tony was super. We have been friends ever since. Tour rate was reasonable for a boat tour and the ticket is 40$. Highly recommend this boat tour even though there were still a few small things to be improved.

Good tour and helpful guide
We start the tour with a rainy day so everything is not so good but i love exploring the nature, the caves, sightseeings and human life at Marble mountains.
The second day is so nice with sunshine. The tour guide is so funny and helpful during the tour then finally we have a good dinner at Hội An ancient town where i fell in love with thousand lanterns everywhere, along the stress and even across the river.
The last one is the food in Hoi An is also so good and special like the people in here.
