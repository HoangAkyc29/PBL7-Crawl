Do yourself a favour!
We had a package of full body massage, facial and body scrub. Approx A$58 each for three hours of pampering. It was amazing and soothing. Well worth every cent.

Great massage for good price!
We booked 2 last minute massages this afternoon and took the 90 minute special - full body and foot massage along with facial for 280,000 VND and it was totally worth it. Very professional service, great firm massage, very soothing face and head massage with the facial.

Sou did the best foot massage ever
Sou did my foot massage 2 nights in a row. Absolutely fantastic. Pressure points hit and an amazing neck massage as well. Ask for Sou.

Massage was just ok
The massage was pretty OK, but it was not my best experience. I have chosen 90 mins body massage, however they cared more about my legs and foot, but spent around 10 mins for the back.
The tip policy is just strange.
I still cannot get the purpose of taking photos of their clients.
There are better massage places in Can Tho with cheaper prices and better service.

Foot Job
We decided that our tired and water soaked feet could use a Vietnamese pedicure and foot massage, and Hana Spa did it right. Relaxing and restorative. Enjoyed!
