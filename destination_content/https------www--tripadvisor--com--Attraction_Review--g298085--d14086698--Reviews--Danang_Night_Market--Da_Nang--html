Could be better
Jul 2023 • Family
We spent two nights here total. The first night was on a weeknight, it was less crowded. The market has many vendors which included food, goods from China, massage vendors. The first night we tried a few items that were decent. There was a lady who gave me some juice that was supposed to be cane but it was not. Didn’t want to make a big fuss about it so we left. It tasted decent, but I knew it was not cane juice. We got two bánh mì sandwiches that were good. We got squid on a skewer which was decent as well. We saw lobster and seafood vendor and the Lady was really nice. She had very good sauce so we wanted to come back because at that point we were already full. Two nights later, we went to the same vendor and she sold us a tray that costed 800,000 dong. However, she told us to sit somewhere further out, and she did not bring us all that we ordered. She did not give us the same sauce, and her attitude was very different after we were sold. Many of the vendors Are not honest and want to raise their prices and not give you what you ask for. This has been a common theme throughout our trip unfortunately. The raise of the price for foreigners.

Danang Night Market should be a local gathering of Vietnam street food booths that offer a variety of dishes representing different areas of Vietnam. Operating every night, however, Danang Night Market has became too commercial and lack of creativity. Most of the food booths offer the same type of already prepared food particularly those unfresh seafood seems from the same factory or supplier. You better go to other small streets to find the great food than eat in the Danang Night Market. Go ther to see the dragon with fire and dragon fas

This is a nice place in a local style. Danang night markets offer visitors dining and shopping paradises with a wide variety of dishes and items. Traveling to Danang, you definitely should come to these markets to immerse yourself in the bustling atmosphere here.

Nice Place to Grab a Bite and Relax
Feb 2020
A cozy place to try a large variety of food! There's a couple of different stalls offering different style of food.
It's a great place to come hang out with some friends, or to make some new ones, while drinking and eating good food.
It's a bit of small market though, I had expected it to be bigger, but it's really nice the way it is. It doesn't overwhelm you and is easy to navigate. It makes for a pleasant experience.
I would definitely like to visit again one day when in I'm in the area again, and highly recommend for the young at heart to go and give it a try.

Doubt u'll find anything worth buying here
Mar 2023 • Couples
Not very impressed with this market and wouldn't have bothered if I'd known what tat it was they were selling. Cheap Chinese goods occupied most stalls.
Had a very substandard foot massage which was frankly a waste of money.
Can't comment on the food as I didn't eat there

Not worth the trip
Dec 2022 • Couples
This is the worst night market I've visited in Vietnam. Very little variance of what's on offer, just a bunch of the same stalls selling the same stuff.

Food is overpriced and not good at all. 30K for a bland pork skewer that took 15 minutes to receive.
There is so much incredible food in Da Nang so this was a real let-down.

Below average night market
Food was overly priced. Not really worth the hype. It didn’t have a lot of variety, every stall was selling the same thing. It dies down after 9pm. We got the beef and octopus skewers and there was no taste to it. It just tasted like charcoal. They bombard you to order drinks when you order food.

Great variety of food
Feb 2020 • Couples
Quite small foodie night market that was close to where we stayed. Has a good variety of food and craft beer. Was always busy whenever we passed by. Worthwhile to take a look.

Don’t waste your time or effort!

Not open and very small. Not worth the effort.Located in the Tourist streets of Da Nang close to the Beach. The main local markets are located near the Dragon bridge ( The head of the Dragon).

I LOVED this. So many things to try, but still a fairly gently experience if you arent used to markets like this. Delicious and affordable food everywhere. Each vendor will ask you “hello! Would you like some [their food stall goodies]?” With menus and pictures. I suggest diving in and trying everything, however, if you would like to pass and keep walking, i found a “no thank you” with a smile was easy and effective. Def bring cash and try everything! There are some repeat items, so its also a good idea to take a lap and plan your snacking. Its also awesome to watch them cook the items you choose.
