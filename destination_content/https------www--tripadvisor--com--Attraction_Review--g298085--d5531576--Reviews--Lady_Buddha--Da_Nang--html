Best day trip we done in Da Nang
The trip here was not planned at all in advance but turned out to be one of the best things we did. We caught a grab from our hotel and they drove us to the parking area, the roads are rather windy but had fab views as you went up. When we arrived we saw a few monkeys wandering around which was great. Really surprised that there is no entrance fee for here. What we loved was how much there was too see, the stunning views and how quiet it was as it was so large and spread out. Happily spent about an hour here, probably could have done longer if it wasn't the middle of of day and really hot

Awe inspiring example of Buddhist religion
Great panoramic views from this sacred site of the sea and surrounding area. Many instagram photos in the courtyard around the Lady Buddha and pagodas. Unique fauna and flora combined with numerous Chinese and Vietnamese statues. Spend two hours and you won‚Äôt regret.

Must visit in Da Nang
Landed in Vietnam, took a break and got a grab car to reach this place at around 4 pm and with wonderful cloudy weather it was just mesmerizing. Lady Buddha - majestic and so blissful standing tall and visible from large parts of coastal da nang. Just so beautiful with all the trees, sculptures and pagodas. Entry is free. Plenty of parking available and getting here is no trouble at all. The view of the coastline and the beaches at sunset is eye soothing. The place is also called monkey mountains but we hardly saw any this day. Must visit !

Iconic Lady Buddha Statue!
This enormous statue overlooks the sea towards the city of Da Nang. It is the tallest statue in the area and is situated within a wonderful park village. There was no admittance charge! Also many great views of Da Nang from this point!

Beautiful statues
We loved walking around and seeing all of the beautiful statues. Lady Buddha is about 67 meters tall and we could see her from Hoi An. We did see a few monkeys running around which was cool. It's too bad people litter so much.

Da Nang highlight
The well manicured site containing a range of interesting gardens in conjunction with the Buddhist religious temples and the Lady Buddha statue. Even if you are not religious the site has much to offer in terms of architecture and garden design. The site was meticulously maintained when we visited. There are areas where there is informative material that will enable a degree of understanding of Buddhist culture. You need to have at least an hour to fully appreciate what the site has to offer. If you go to Da Nang and do not visit the Lady Buddha you have missed the best part.

A must visitüëçüèº
What a fantastic area to visit, photo opportunities are endless and the whole area is very impressive. We were advised to get there early which paid off massively, got there 7.30ish Sunday morning and pretty much had the place to ourselves for half an hour although when we were leaving it was getting busier. This is a must doüëçüèº

The intricate carvings and statues of the Lady Buddha are truly breathtaking
I found the experience to be very enlightening and calming. The place itself is a beautiful sight to behold. The intricate carvings and statues of the Lady Buddha are truly breathtaking and make for a great photo opportunity. The grounds are well maintained and the atmosphere is peaceful and serene.

This is a good site to visit. Firstly it‚Äôs free to enter. The site itself has multiple areas to explore so allow minimum 90 minutes but I would suggest 2 to 2.5 hours plus travel time. There are many marble statues and sculptured trees adding to the overall experience and the site was well maintained.

A serene garden with a majestic Quan Yin Buddha
Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples
A short 10 minute drive from the hotel strip brings you to this serene garden with a majestic Quan Yon Buddha that takes your breath away as you gaze up to her delightful face. The vast number of sculptures and mature bonsais keep you entertained. You may peek into a few temples as you stroll the grounds. For those of you looking for monkeys, hang around the parking lot for a bit of mischievous fun... All in all, an hour well spent.

Beautiful architecture, delightful monkeys
Lady Buddha herself is an incredible sight. The bonsai gardens surrounding were elegant and understated.

The section in front of the lady Buddha is surrounded by the red face monkeys, they are an absolute treat to watch. Finding snacks wherever they can and just going about their business. A definite trip highlight.

Interesting visit of Buddhist temple
If you take a scooter the place is about a 20-30 minutes drive from downtown Da Nang, outside the city. You can park your scooter and walk around, visiting the Lady Buddha statue and the temple area. It's a nice visit popular also with local tourists, giving some insights into local culture and religion.

Serenity Now!
Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Solo
I‚Äôm in awe! The largest Lady Buddha I‚Äôve ever seen. Lady Buddha is the protector of Danang, as she has the power to re-route potential dangerous typhoon in a different direction. She is highly revered for the love she has for the people of Danang. The beautiful bonsai plants adored her lady. When visiting, make sure you truly take a good look at how intricate these plants are. I so enjoyed it so much. As I do my mindfulness, I had the chance to touch these amazing plants. The beautiful blue sky complimented the Lady. I can see Lady Buddha from my hotel room. I thank her for caring for Danang.
Remember, take lots of pictures here to take home to remind you of a serene place.

Such a beauty
We went through this place after getting good recommendation. One evening we were next to the beach where we could see light lit on the frame and gives splendid view. After reaching to the place our theme was covered. Its a beautiful place to visit. Worth being there.

Well worth a visit
Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Use Grab app to get picked up in Danang, and consider a round trip as it can get busy at the parking lot. We didn‚Äôt do round trip though and were still fine in booking another Grab once we‚Äôd done.
Spent in total about 60-90 mins here walking around the statue, pagoda and admiring the views. Can also watch the monkeys but be careful as we saw one or two getting angry at stupid tourists trying to get too close.
No entry fee and expect many tourists here, but all in all absolutely worth a trip.

Good Side Trip
Feb 2024 ‚Ä¢ Family
The pagoda in Son Tra is not very far from Da Nang but there are some hilly roads to climb if you drive or ride a bike. So to make things easier and relaxing we just booked a day tour with other side trips. Our guide gave us sufficient time to visit and take pictures. It is indeed a good place to take beautiful pictures if you like taking pictures otherwise you do not need to stay long in that place. It was winter when we went there so it was very windy and chilly with a bit of rain, so you need to check the weather before going there at different times or season. There are many figurine character statues and the bonsais are very well kempt and beautiful.

Apart from Lady Buddha and temples nothing special
Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Nice little trip, lots of sculptures and temples.
- no entry!!
Guarded parking available, no pay only donation, you pay what you want.
Steep way up, take scooter with minimum 90cc.
Drinks are possible to buy there.
There is a man walking around the assembly who wants money for donation purposes and will first ask you to fill a survey about the location and your satisfaction.
Not sure if he is legit or a scam.
