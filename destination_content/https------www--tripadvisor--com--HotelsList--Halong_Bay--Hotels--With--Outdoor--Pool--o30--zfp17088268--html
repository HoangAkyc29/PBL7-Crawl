San Juan
Shanghai
The largest city in China is also its most cosmopolitan, offering visitors a chance to experience the past, present, and future all at once. The Huangpu River splits Shanghai into two districts: Pudong and Puxi. The Pudong skyline looks like it was ripped from the Jetsons, with the bulbous Oriental Pearl TV and Radio Tower looking a bit like a two headed lollipop. On the Puxi side, you can walk the Bund riverside district to get a taste of old Shanghai.

Istanbul
Over the centuries, many cultures have added their mark to this prized piece of land. Today, you can experience those influences firsthand by exploring Istanbulâ€™s mahalles (neighborhoods). From the holy sites of Sultanahmet and the 19th-century European elegance of BeyoÄŸlu to the high fashion of NiÅŸantaÅŸÄ±, the vibrant cafÃ© society of KadÄ±kÃ¶y and the football-loving streets of BeÅŸiktaÅŸ, itâ€™s easy to see why travelers say that Istanbul isnâ€™t just one city, but many cities within one.
