Recommended trip to Halong bay in one day
Beautiful trip, very good guide. The van was very comfortable to go to Halong Bay. Everything was as in the tour program. The ship was very nice and a good lunch on it. We have seen many things and drove in a canoe boat. It was a long and amazing trip.

Halong Bay Cruise
We really loved this cruise and would definitely recommend it to all our friends and family! The staff were so kind and accomodating, they even upgraded our room for free and helped us with whatever we needed. Our room came with our own private balcony and a jacuzzi. The food on board was spectacular, with lunch and dinner having multiple courses. The boat and the room was very clean and well kept. It was super fun doing the activities and we took full advantage of them.

Great staff and amazing service
I went as a solo traveller and was not keen to do everything but the great manage Ha made me so comfortable said what ever l want to do. Also I’m a very fussy eater and could not eat first night but they adapted to make it to my liking the next day and it was beautiful, Ha the manager is great and the staff are amazing, nothing is too much. The day l didn’t do the trip the staff member brought me my breakfast I’m my room, did so much to make me comfortable and so create full.

Once in a lifetime experience
Ha Long Bay was at the top of my list for this vacation, and it exceeded expectations. It's so incredibly beautiful! I really enjoyed being able to swim in the bay surrounded by gorgeous views, and the team at Paradise Indochina was superb. I also used this company to visit the Ba Vi mountains, which were stunning. Both tour guides, Tom and Sonny, were extremely professional, as well.
