Great chef and authentic experience
We really had a great time doing to cooking class with Thuy. The place is very beautiful, surrounded by a garden - very cozy atmosphere. We were allowed choose a menu ourselfes out of five options and it was delicious. Before the class you visit the market, which is so cool to see since you have a local with you. The cooking class itself is a lot of fun and you get so many useful tips. We can't wait to cook all the recepies back home. I can definately recommend you to do Thuy's cooking class, it's a blast!

Unforgettable experience in Halong Bay !
We booked a half day city tour in Halong Bay and our wonderful tour guide was Cuong . How lucky we were to get Cuong ! He was so informative and was full of pride of his home town . He was very accommodating to our needs and changed the itinerary around to what he thought would suit us better , we had a very enjoyable and memorable morning/afternoon full of history and culture and in the mix plenty of jokes and laughter.
We would highly recommend Cuong for your next tour in Halong Bay .

Thanks Cuong !!

Very enjoyable cruise
Had a fabulous 2 night/3day cruise on Halong Bay as part of a Mercury Vietnam Odyssey trip. Loved our cabin which was spacious enough for the trip. Very clean & most areas seemed to be well maintained. We had no issues. Middle deck had dining room and upper deck was for chilling. Sunbathing on the deck & nice drinks up there in the evening. Drinks were a wee bit pricey we thought. Food was amazing & beautifully presented & service professional. Lots of fish/seafood, but non fish people were well catered for too. Scenery was spectacular and the trips out in the tender were enjoyable. There was even night fishing. This cruise was one of the highlights of the whole trip. Thoroughly recommend.
