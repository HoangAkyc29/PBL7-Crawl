Howard‚Äôs visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Halong Bay is a stunning destination with unspoiled nature, breathtaking views, and luxurious cruises. It is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. The scenery is simply stunning and the luxury cruises make it even more enjoyable. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

I Day Boat Trip with Lunch on the Boat
Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples
I would not recommend this trip as it was far too busy too enjoy!!
Too many people and boats you felt like herded cattle.
The day started good we were picked up from our hotel the coach was good, as soon as we got near the boat pick up the coaches were everywhere, chaos!!
The boat was nice and lunch was good !!
As soon as we got to Halong Bay the boats were like bumper cars trying to get in as so many.
The queue for the caves was ridiculous we were shoulder to shoulder!!
It‚Äôs a shame this trip is not enjoyable just far too many people.
I am giving the star for the boat as this part was good.

Always wanted to visit - little taken back
May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo
To start off you need to know I live in New Zealand...land of clean green rivers and lakes.
So I spent two nights in ha long bay to get to really see the area and the sites , this first thing to note is it is really touristy, a bit
Ike Niagara Falls, a natural wonder surrounded by high rises etc..., ha long is boarded by alot of shipping docks and massive city construction all pushed to tourism. You don't actually travel far into the bay . And all the other boats are there with you each day. The big problem is pollution...it is really bad , oil slicks , floating debris in the water and not a clean beach anywhere.
So again I am from nz so this took me back and I was disappointed, but talking to others that come from different parts , they loved the area.
So different strokes for different folks

Not worth it!
May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples
I have been to Langkawi, Fiji, Palawan and Krabi so I have seen plenty of beautiful limestone cliffs and paradise landscapes.
All of them are nicer than Halong Bay.
Sorry to say, but Halong Bay just isn't worth it. The water is dirty, rubbish floats around the sea, the jetty feels like an airport such is the volume of tourists piling onto the hundreds of boats that overcrowd the bay.
Basically, Vietnam has killed the goose that laid the golden egg by mismanaging what should be a world class attraction. For anyone going to Thailand or Phillippines after Vietnam, I suggest giving Halong Bay a miss. The bay is overrated, expensive to visit, and by not going you will be doing our planet a favor.

UNESCO Heritage site. One of the wonders of the world. Could be but isn't. If UNESCO put their name to it they should STOP the boy racer driven, thrill seeking idiot- tourist speedboats destroying the natural wonder of the Bay. It is a wonderous, beautiful natural place and truly a wonder of the world - NOT a bloody race track. These people, the boy racer half wits and their idiot passengers are an insult to the place. I think great efforts are ongoing (at UNESCO's insistence ) to clean up the rubbish from the Bay, but that's a losing battle throughout the world. But for Christ's sake stop these idiots ruining it further.

Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo
I can not agree more to my previous travel expert. It is a bloody noisy and dusty place. I did plan, pay and book everything ahaed, but not the sailing boat and the harbour cruise. Weather was moderate to poor in 2 1/2 days, so I was "only" stuck but deeply disappointed as there is really nothing else one can do. The main road will look soon like Las Vegas. About 80 new developments coming up in yellow, white, pink and green. Artdeco style but so does not fit in the landscape. And yes, there is plenty of loud and inexperienced Chinese travellers in the area. Patience and quietness is not their biggest strength.

Polluted, overcrowded, disastrous!
This was probably the lowest point of our Vietnam trip. We went on a 1day trip from Hanoi. The trip started of bad since the bus was really small and uncomfortable and the toilet stop was waaaaay too long (same for the way back).
We thought we were ready for the massive crowds of tourists, but this was on a next level. Hundreds, if not thousands of people go to the same three spots in the same order, like there is no common sense. The boats crash with each other to get the tourist out and on the boat which can be quite dangerous.

I could bear all of that, but when i saw the polluted water, this is what hurt me the most. It‚Äôs terrible what they have done with this place. I believe it used to be nice but there is basically nothing to enjoy there. When we went on the kayak and we were close to the water we could actually smell the terrible smell that came from the water. I would not swim in there if my life depended on it.
So do yourself a favor and skip it since it‚Äôs only gonna get worse unless the government will shut it down and let it recover.

HALONG EXPLORER CRUISE
Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Halong Bay is simply beautiful and a number one must see in Vietnam. We had a great time in Halong Bay doing some kayaking through the caves, some trekking and squid fishing. The trip is organized by Halong Explorer Cruise, the cruise itself is clean, food is good and staff are very helpful, they go beyond our expection and try best to make sure we enjoy our time.

Unique Journey to Ha Long Bay
Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family
Serenity Cruises is very good choice to explore Ha Long Bay. Instead of touristy area (Like Sung Sot Cave or Luon Cave) they keep cruising much further to very quite view where 40 km far away. Anchor in Lan Ha Bay for a nite is perfect moment and visiting Viet Hai village the next day.
If you are looking for a quite route and a real Ha Long - Lan Ha - Cat Ba island, Ha Long Serenity Cruises recommended.

THE WORST TOUR COMPANY I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH
Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo
This was by far the worst tour experience of my life. The tour was full of what was a decidedly mediocre tour full of blunders and poor customer service. The first issue was that the air conditioning in the rooms wasn't turned on until after 8:30pm despite it being over 33 degrees celsius out plus humidity. The second was that the food was plainly terrible. After having the most amazing food everywhere I'd been in Vietnam, this mash of westernized combination of chinese and japanese food was really disappointing. All the food was clearly microwaved and it tasted awful. The beds on the boats were like sleeping on bare box springs, you could feel the springs poking through the bed. Crazy uncomfortable beds even for Vietnam where most beds are hard as rock. The boat staff were quite rude and although we had purchased many drinks from their bar, they demanded that we drink the one bottle of wine we brought with us in our room (the un-airconditioned one that was like a sauna) or pay them a service charge. The cruise was cut short due to an incoming storm which wasn't their fault obviously, but rather than just refund the guests the difference for missing some of the meals and activities, they insisted on taking us kayaking at 6am and missing lunch.
All of that could have been chalked up to just bad luck on my part, but the worst part of the whole experience is that on top of all of that they gave me back another passenger's passport, rather than my own! I realized it when I was about to leave for the airport and missed my flight. Thankfully, I had made friends with the other passenger and though she was all the way in Danang, was able to get a hold of her. The tour company did handle getting the passports couriered back to us, but I had to change my flight and stay another night in a hotel which they promised to pay for. All in all this massive blunder cost me over $300 usd. The tour company has done absolutely nothing to compensate me in fact they have ignored or not replied to all of the messages I've sent requesting that this be dealt with.
I HIGHLY recommend avoiding APT tours at all costs. They not only offer a very low quality cruise experience, they are not careful with customer's belongings and do absolutely nothing to resolve a situation when they do screw up. I am utterly dismayed with the way this mess was handled.
