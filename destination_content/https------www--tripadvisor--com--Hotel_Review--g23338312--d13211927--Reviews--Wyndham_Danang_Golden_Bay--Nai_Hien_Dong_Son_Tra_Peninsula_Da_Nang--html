Surrounded by the majestic the Son Tra Peninsula and the brilliant blue waters of Danang Bay, Wyndham Danang Golden Bay provides the ultimate retreat for business and leisure travelers. Our unparalleled downtown location is minutes from the city center and must-see attractions like the Danang Cathedral, Danang Museum of Cham Sculpture, and Han Market. You’ll be eight kilometers from Danang International Airport (DAD) and five kilometers from the powdery white sands of My Khe Beach—both reachable via our free shuttle. You’ll love our contemporary, non-smoking hotel’s magnificent amenities and outstanding 24/7 service. Enjoy a swim in the 29th floor Golden Infinity Pool, covered in 24K gold tiles and boasting breathtaking views of the sunset and endless horizon. Indulge with a massage or Korean steam bath at the Golden Luxury Spa, remain committed to your workout routine in the state-of-the-art fitness center, and explore miniature versions of iconic sites like the Statue of Liberty and Eiffel Tower with free access to the on-site Wonder Park. You’ll eat and drink very well throughout your stay with a free buffet breakfast every morning and a lineup of fantastic restaurants and bars that include Danang’s first halal eatery and a hip rooftop lounge serving decadent golden beef and handcrafted cocktails. After a busy day, you’ll love retreating to one of our 949 guest rooms and suites, featuring stunning bay or city views, a private balcony, ergonomic workspace, gold bath fixtures, 24/7 room service, and so much more. If you’re planning a meeting, wedding, or celebration, we offer five polished venues that can accommodate up to 315 conference guests or 250 banquet guests. We cater to kids with a children’s pool, play area, and Kids’ Club and simplify your stay with conveniences like free WiFi and parking, a concierge, and tour desk.

Beautiful hotel. Came here with family and girlfriend. Great views of the lake and bridge. A little isolated but that was nice that there were no noise and was not hard to go around the place. If I ever come back to De Nang, I would definitely come back.
