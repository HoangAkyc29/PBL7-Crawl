thg 10 năm 2017 • Doanh nghiệp
Vịnh Hạ Long 2 lần công nhận là di sản thiên nhiên thế giới với hàng nghìn hòn đảo được làm nên bởi tạo hóa kỳ vĩ và sống động. Vịnh có phong cảnh tuyệt đẹp, hấp dẫn với du khách trong nước và quốc tế.
Tuy nhiên vấn đề vệ sinh môi trường còn gặp nhiều bất cập. Dịch vụ ăn uống trên tàu còn yếu.

Một chuyến khó quên... Trên đường di chuyển từ HN đến HL được ghé thăm nơi sản xuất đồ mỹ nghệ: tranh khảm, trang sức bằng ngọc trai, vỏ ốc,... vô cùng đẹp; được mở mang khá nhiều. Thuyền tàu đầy đủ tiện nghi, sạch sẽ, đẹp và sang trọng k thua kém j các khách sạn trên bờ. Chuyến đi này cho chúng tôi một cảm giác thoải mái, thư giãn, để lại 1 ấn tượng khó quên không chỉ bởi cảnh đẹp hùng vĩ, mà còn bởi sự phục vụ, hướng dẫn nhiệt tình của các nhân viên trên tàu thuyền và cả anh hướng dẫn viên vui tính, có tâm hết sức luôn. Thank you!

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

For those who love sunrise and sunset…
Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Memorable and enchanting sunsets
We had the most amazing experience at Renea Cruise Halong! From the panoramic ocean views to the comfortable and stable cruising experience, I was in awe of the beauty of Halong Bay. But the highlight of my stay was the incredible sunsets! Every night, I watched as the sun slowly set over the bay, painting the sky with a mesmerizing array of colors. It was truly a memorable and enchanting sight!

Overnight stay on a Junk on Halong Bay
Feb 2024 • Couples
The Junk we stayed on was called The Victory.
It was clean and the staff were very friendly. Food they serve was very plentiful and good.
The bedrooms were compacted and had all you needed. The beds were very hard but for an overnight stay it wasn’t too bad.
The view of Halong bay is breath taking and would recommend to anyone to go there.
Went to the cave and went on a boat to see some of Halong. If you wanted to you could kayak.
Breath taking scenery.

The cruising and boat during through Halong Bay is a magical, scenic and picturesque experience. Photos honestly don't do this place justice! A sunset here was an experience I'll remember for a life time.
The only negative is in some parts the water was populated and dirty was was a downer.... We need to preserve this place!!

Beautiful Place
Nov 2022
This is definitely one of the most beautiful places I have ever been and a must do if you're in Vietnam because it genuinely is stunning. We did a 1 night cruise (forgive me, I can't remember the name of it) and the views were astonishing, and it was great going to a little island for a swim and some boat jumping. We also did kayaking and again, the best views I've ever experienced when kayaking.
The only downside is, as some other reviewers have mentioned, the rubbish. I wouldn't go as far as to say it ruined the experience but there was a bit more pollution than I thought. I only really noticed it when kayaking though and it wasn't ALL OVER it was just in certain bits. Thing is, though, that's the reality of our world isn't it. Humans have managed to damage even the most beautiful places.

Lovely views. You can spend a day looking at beautiful scenery without getting bored. Natural beauty everywhere you see it. One of the best places I have visited. You also get to visit the caves and islands if you have taken one of the tours. Not disappointed with anything at this place. Must visit if you are around.
