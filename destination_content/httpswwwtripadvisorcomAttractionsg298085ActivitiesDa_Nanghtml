1. The Marble Mountains
7,993
Mountains
Discover the tunnels and grottoes within Thuy Son, the only one of the five Marble Mountains that’s open to travelers. Marvel at the Buddhist temples carved into the rock, then head to the hilltop overlook for awe-inspiring views of the city. Join a guided tour to learn more about the history of the mountains. To reach the summit, take the elevator or climb the stairs; if you choose to do the latter, be very careful as the marble steps tend to be slippery. Visit early in the morning or later in the day to escape the midday heat and beat the crowds. – Tripadvisor

Amusement & Theme Parks
Admission tickets from $53
This theme park is a popular day trip from the coastal city of Da Nang, about a 45-minute drive. Start with a fantastic cable car ride, catching a brilliant sunset if you arrive here late afternoon. Once you’ve made your ascent, cross the Golden Bridge, held aloft by a giant pair of hands. There are many other attractions here—don’t miss the Linh Ung Pagoda and the giant Buddha statue. Check the weather forecast before booking your tickets, as even if conditions are relatively mild in Da Nang, it can be wet, windy, and foggy at the top in the colder months. – Tripadvisor

4. Dragon Bridge
5,905
This 2,185-foot-long bridge shaped like an undulating golden dragon is the most famous bridge over the Han River in downtown Danang. On weekend nights, the dragon comes to life in quite an unusual way: the bridge is closed to traffic, and the massive dragon head on the east end of the bridge releases bursts of flames and water in a spectacular night show. Prepare to get wet if you stand on the bridge near the head. Otherwise, you can view the spectacle from the river bank along Tran Hung Dao Street or many of the nearby rooftop bars. The bridge is usually a stop on a night tour of Da Nang. – Tripadvisor

7. Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture
1,525
Speciality Museums
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is one of the first museums built in Vietnam by the French. The main building was constructed in 1915. It evokes some motifs of French colonial architecture in the early twentieth century and resembles the image of the Champa temples - towers in Central Viet Nam. Visitors will have the opportunity to contemplate more than 400 artifacts on display, including National Treasures and others representing the masterpieces of Champa sculpture in ten centuries (from 5th to 15th). The artifacts were made in a variety of materials, such as sandstone, terracotta, and metal. Grounded in various themes from fertility symbols, deities, mythical animals and architectural decoration from the Hindu and Buddhist, they express the features of cultural and religious values of the Champa people over many generations. The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is a must-see destination for visitors wishing to discover the culture and heritage of Central Viet Nam.

11. 3D Museum Art in Paradise Danang
318
Art Museums
Art in Paradise Danang is the first 3D Trick Art Museum in Danang and the largest one in Viet Nam. Come to the museum, you will be suprised by hundreds of 3D art works. They were all drawn and painted by hand that used three-dimensional and scientific method combinations to make the paintings look realistic and live, and you can be part of them. It's not just an art, but a paradise. You will have a lot of happy memories with your family and friends here. Love!
12. Golden Bridge
772
This striking bridge is one of the most photographed spots in Da Nang, located within Ba Na Hills. This 500-foot-long golden bridge appears to be cradled by two gigantic hands amidst the clouds. Get there early in the morning to snap a shot on the bridge without the crowds. It connects the hilltop cable car station to the stunning Paradise Gardens, and you can enjoy breathtaking views of the East Sea and the Annamite Mountains as you cross. Check out the bridge on a guided tour of Ba Na Hills from Da Nang or Hoi An—it usually includes the cable car ride, the French Village, and Fantasy Park as well. – Tripadvisor

Go with CARE
We throughly enjoyed going here and seeing the monuments. It’s a unique, beautiful place only a short distance from downtown Da Nang. A few notes before you go:

Stairs - There are 100s of them in all shapes and sizes and they can get slippery. I agree with others you should not visit if you have trouble with them.
Crowds - It can get VERY busy. Patience (especially in the stairs) can be required at times.
Time of Day - To maximize the experience, know when the sun will approach or be over the cave to create the light rays (seen in most ads).

A bridge with a view or two
Called here as part of a trip whilst on a cruise. It's a bridge and if you start at one end and travel along it you will end up at the other end of the bridge. If you do that in reverse then the same is true. Unlike other bridges this one is supported by giant concrete hands but similar to many other bridges there are some great views.

Dragon Fire and Water
The Fire and Water show is Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I read that best place is on bridge. It is if you want to get wet from the water show. I think that better view is on the roads beneath the bridge as better perspective of dragon. Doesn’t last very long but good fun.

Gigantic Lady Buddha and temples
This was a really beautiful spot. There is the large pagoda, statues, a traditional temple and of course the large lady Buddha that you can see from the beach in Danang. It was a lovely site to walk around and the views were fantastic

Fascinating
We took our time going through these exhibits. Good thing we finished before the school field trips and noisy tour groups came. Dear Management, please instruct the teachers NOT to blow their whistle to call the attention of the high school kids. After all, this is a Museum.

Reminds you how to Play
My husband and I visited on our recent trip to Vietnam. We had so much fun "playing" with all the artwork. The examples they have for photos are great as we were unsure about how to pose for some of them. A few of the arrows showing where to stand were missing but it didn't take away from our overall experience. If you are looking for a fun way to spend an hour or two definitely stop by.

The main reason you pay 50$
Yes, you basically pay 50$ to see this heavily advertised bridge, which in short time became one of Vietnam symbols, despite country's rich history, great cities and fab landscape. Other attractions included in that ticket are mediocre at best - pretty kitschy French village, ordinary cable car and underwhelming rides.
And, that Vietnamese symbol is a theme park bridge. My daughter asked me if it has some historic importance, and was surprised when I told her it was built 10y ago.
However, as most of you will come up to see it yourself (like myself) I point down some tips to make the most of your day and not leave disappointed.
Despite my intro up, I must admit the bridge is impressive, set in a unique place - often above clouds.
It is overpriced, but you'll pay that price despite of that and they know it.
TIPS:
- WEATHER is the most important factor. Watch the weather forecast for the following days and choose the day showing clear weather,
- BE there at 7.30 AM to catch the first cable car up. Website is showing they're open from 7 AM, but this is only for Sun World hotel residents. Outside visitors are let at 7.45 AM to go up,
- Grab ride from Da Nang costs around 15$ one way. At 6.30-7 AM it needs around 45 min, later significantly longer due to traffic,
- Arriving so early is double effective: you'll have the bridge for yourself (and very few others) and, you'll have more options (time) to have better weather. When we came up at 8 AM it was totally clear with amazing visibility and almost no one around (see the pics). At 10 AM it was totally cloudy with hordes of people.
- BUY the tickets when you arrive at the theme park entrance (NO need to do it beforehand),
- Buy the tickets WITH BUFFET lunch included. For around extra 12$ you get a real feast at 4 Seasons restaurant. Huge choice of quality food: Viet, Korean, Jap, Thai, western cuisine,...juices and water included, great deal. Have your lunch earlier, before or around noon - at peak times 1-2 PM also huge crowds and fight for food,
- Do the bridge first, anyway it's right there when you exit the cable car. After, you have all the time to explore the theme park according to your likings,
- To avoid even those few who came with you walk first to the other (further) hand, as everybody will naturally stop by the first hand
