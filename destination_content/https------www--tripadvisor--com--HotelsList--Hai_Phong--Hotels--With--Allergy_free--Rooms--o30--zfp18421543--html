Cat Ba
Halong Bay
Travelers visit Halong Bay for an up-close look at its amazing limestone islands, rock formations and caves. Whittled away over centuries by wind and water, theyâ€™re breathtaking. Rent a kayak or a junk boat, or take a tour to explore.

Hanoi
The charming Vietnamese capital has aged well, preserving the Old Quarter, monuments and colonial architecture, while making room for modern developments alongside. Hanoi may have shrugged off several former names, including Thang Long, or "ascending dragon," but it hasn't forgotten its past, as sites such as Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum and Hoa Lo Prison attest. Lakes, parks, shady boulevards and more than 600 temples and pagodas add to the appeal of this city, which is easily explored by taxi.
Ninh Binh
Popular destinations for Hotels with Allergy-free Rooms
Mui Ne
Ancient civilization gets a tropical beach twist in Mui Ne, a resort town in southeast Vietnam. Formidable Cham towers seem to keep watch over the visitors who come here for the epic kitesurfing or to frolic along the sand dunes. Candy-colored fishing vessels bob gently in the waters of Mui Ne Harbor, where you can buy steamed seafood thatâ€™s literally fresh off the boat.
Jodhpur
Surrounded by a huge fortress wall with bastions, the striking blue buildings in Jodhpur contrast sharply and beautifully with the neighboring Thar Desert. Exploring the palaces, forts and temples will keep you busy and in awe of the cityâ€™s historic grandeur. Bazaars offer a range of beautiful textiles, embroidered leather goods, lacquerware, antiques, carpets, puppets and figurines. Jodhpur is a popular tourist destination and a convenient base for travel in the region.
Kazan
On the banks of the Volga River, Kazan sits austerely, its cityscape a visual confection of architecture that somehow manages to be both playful and severe. No matter your spiritual inclination, you simply must visit the Temple of All Religions, a Technicolor cultural center built by artist Ildar Khanov. Though still a work in progress, the "temple" is a feast for the eyesâ€”and the spirit.
Adler
Boasting montane surroundings, subtropical beaches, and a major railway terminal, Adler is unsurprisingly one of Russiaâ€™s most popular Black Sea resorts. Arguably more affordable than its Olympic neighbor Sochi, Adlerâ€™s parks, museums, and churches provide plenty to do beyond sunbathing.
Lindos
Youâ€™ll have three beaches to choose from in Lindos: calm Pallas Beach, secluded St. Paulâ€™s Bay, and the main beach, Megali Paralia. Save time to explore the town itself, too. Itâ€™s a bit of a hike up to the acropolis, but the view is magnificent.
