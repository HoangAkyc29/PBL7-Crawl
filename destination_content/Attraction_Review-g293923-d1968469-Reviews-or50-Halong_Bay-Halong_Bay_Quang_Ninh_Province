Trong chuyến đi đến Hạ Long vào tháng truớc, mình đã có dịp chiêm ngưỡng biểu tuợng của Vịnh là "Hòn Trống Mái". Với hình dáng kì lạ, 2 tảng đá lớn đứng cạnh nhau như một đôi vợ chồng =))))). Bên cạnh đó ẩm thực ở đây rất ngon, luôn tuơi mới, nguời dân thân thiện, mến khách. Đây chắc chắn là điểm du lịch phải đến một lần trong đời đó nhé =))))))))

Điểm DL nên trải nghiệm
thg 5 năm 2019
🙋‍♀️ Vịnh Hạ Long (vịnh nơi rồng đáp xuống) là một vịnh nhỏ thuộc phần bờ tây vịnh Bắc Bộ tại khu vực biển Đông Bắc Việt Nam, bao gồm vùng biển đảo thuộc thành phố Hạ Long, thành phố Cẩm Phả và một phần huyện đảo Vân Đồn của tỉnh Quảng Ninh.
🎒👒🕶🙋‍♀️ Giá cả ăn uống ở địa phương hơi đắt đỏ so với nhiều địa điểm khác.
Không chỉ đẹp bởi cảnh sắc “mây trời sóng nước”, vẻ đẹp nên thơ hay vô số những đảo đá vôi nổi trên mặt nước, Hạ Long còn đem lại cho du khách cảm giác bình yên khi hòa mình vào cảnh vật nơi đây. Được đánh giá là một trong 29 Vịnh đẹp nhất thế giới, cuối tháng 3/2012, tổ chức New Open World cũng đã chính thức công nhận vịnh Hạ Long là một trong bảy kỳ quan thiên nhiên mới của thế giới.
Nên trải nghiệm thử 1 lần để biết Việt Nam còn nhiều điều khám phá lắm.

Bố mẹ mình và các bác có dịp ra ngoài Hạ Long chơi và đi tham quan ngủ đêm trên vịnh đầu tháng 5 vừa rồi. Mọi người cảm thấy rất vui, ngạc nhiên với vẻ đẹp của vịnh hạ long. Đây là 1 điểm đến rất nổi tiếng của Việt Nam trong mắt du khách nước ngoài cũng như người dân địa phương. Hy vọng trong những năm tới vịnh Hạ Long càng thu hút được nhiều khách đến tham quan. Ngoài ra ban quản lý vịnh Hạ Long cũng cần phải có phương án giải quyết triệt để tình trạng rác nổi trên vịnh vì nó làm ảnh hưởng đến vẻ đẹp cảnh quan nơi đây.

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Heritage Cruises
Dec 2023 • Couples
We were picked up from our hotel in the Old Quarter at about 8am and about a 2-hour journey to Halong Bay pier (this was pre-paid with the tour company in advance for $45 USD return/person). The transfer van limo was very comfortable and had wifi and charging stations. When we arrived we were greeted by the Heritage Cruises team, checked in, and waited another 1 hour for other groups to join the tour.

We boarded a separate boat that took us to the main Heritage Cruise boat. Would recommend booking one of the suites as the balcony was worth the extra money. The staff on board were friendly and helpful and service was fantastic. John, the manager was personable and informed us on the team and also the activities. The chef and his team took extra care to prepare special meals and even accommodated for my nut allergies and made the dishes without nuts. The Pho was the best we had on our trip to Vietnam. Drinks were not included but were reasonable.
We would recommend booking the 2 night 3 day tour, as we got to do the special activities: swimming and kayaking on the beach, the boat tour of the caves, and the visit to the fishing village, the cooking class (we missed the Tai Chi and Squid fishing). The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the lunch on the island in the fishing village which was mostly fried which was not like on the main cruise. The staff team was very knowledgeable and friendly and the tour of the history of Viet Hai was very interesting. We were also able to ride bikes into the village which was super fun and you can get some great photos along the ride.
Summary:
Pros: Great Cruise Team friendly and helpful, Amazing Halong Bay Views, Delicious Meals, and caring staff.
Cons: Variable Weather (do check before booking as it was cold on the days we were there.), Food on the island trip (not directly related to the food on the boat which was fantastic, maybe a packed lunch from the boat would be better if you have any allergies).

Personally I thought the place was over rated. Over run with tourism, murky water and scenery low grade beaches.
I watered to go for a swim but did not like what I saw floating past. Spent three days here and saw the sun once.
The cycle trip to Cat Ba island was awesome. Easy ride. Great to get out to the countryside.

Had a full day visit to this beautiful natural wonder on Dec-21,2023 on a passenger cruise called "Dong Duong 01" Started off by cruising to the limestone caves admiring the stalactites and stalagmites & then re-boarded the cruise for an Indian lunch. Then went to the first floor / deck and just watched as we cruised all over the bay and also saw the symbol of Hanoi rocks.

The Best Attraction I have ever visited
Ha Long Bay is very quite and calm place. Extremely beautiful, I wonder whether you can find such a place in any where else in the world. We stay one night in Amanda Cruise . Very nice and friendly staff. It is about 165 km from Hanoi. We had early breakfast from the hotel. On the way to Ha Long bay stopped to see the Pearl Factory. Reached the Cruise around 2.00 pm.
