Tiring but finally amaizing journey
Feb 2024 • Business
The view is amazing, the marble mountain is fabolous. We took many amazing photos in the cave... the journey by taking stairs is tiring but at the end is worth to see..

Country side tour
Feb 2024 • Couples
Great tour to see the country side outside of the old quarter. I would defiantly suggest to hang back in Hoi An after, see the town and the night market to experience everything.

Tour guide was great and accommodated our changes last minute.

Hue is awesome, great recommendations
Dec 2023 • Family
Hue is a very knowledgeable, accommodating and professional guide. Our family of 12 did a private 8hr long tour of lady Buddha, marble mountain and old Hoi A town with him including lunch at a yummy noodle shop. He even made a reservation for our New Year’s Eve dinner at an exciting spot in old town. Highly recommend him!

Visit My Son, do not use this tour
I am sorry to say I cannot recommend this package, as it is not really a package. It is just a ride from the hotel to My Son. No guide or temple tickets as the listing implies. At over $100, the price is absurd. You csn easily use a Grab taxi for half the price.
My Son is worth visiting, but wear sturdy shoes with a good grip.
Do not eat at the restaurant at entrance (as our "guide" told us to do before he left us on our own). Food is mediocre at best. Service is poor. Go inside and get a drink and Banh Mi.

Excellent Danang Tour Guide
Excellent English speaking and pleasant tour guide and very accommodating to family travelling with children and senior citizen. Very accommodating and efficient in terms of tour ideas/choices. Took 2 tour packages for group of 6 pax (Bana Hills and LingUng-Hoi An) and no regrets. Highly recommended. Transportation provided was spacious and clean. Tour guide was also an excellent photographer.

Amazing tour guide Mr. Nhược
Dec 2023 • Couples
We had a private tour with Mr. Nhược. Not only we learned about My Son but thanks to him we learned so many things about Vietnam and the culture. He was very kind and informative, and we had a lovely afternoon thanks to him. We definitely recommend seeing My Son with Mr. Nhược if you have time!

Hoi An Trip
It was enjoyable to explore the serene villages by bike. Riding the coconut basket boat was unique (you'll never find a boat in this shape, and do try out the attraction where they spin your boat) and the cooking class was fun! The food was also delicious!
