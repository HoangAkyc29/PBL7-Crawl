Howard‚Äôs visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Other wordly
Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

V‚Äôspirit 2 day 1 night trip to Halong bay
Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family
We were a bit dubious as to if we should do the ‚Äú Halong bay‚Äù trip as some reviews I had read did not sound appealing. We chose to go for a 2 day 1 night trip aboard the V ‚Äò Spirit, as almost all the reviews were great. I have to say this was a highlight of our trip. From booked to communication and pick up from our hotel we could not fault the staff, very friendly and funny. The boat was older but clean and better than expected, the room small but adequate, the only complaint was the bed was hard, but hey it‚Äôs one night. We had the most magnificent 10 course lunch absolutely delicious. Followed by a brilliant trip into the magnificent caves and a hike. There were a lot of other boats but that is to be expected. All and all we had a fantastic time.... this cruise is really value for money the food well above a 3 star boat... thank you V spirit for a great trip

Not too impressed
Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family
Couple of my friends and our kids went to Hanoi for a short Christmas trip and booked a day tour for Halong Bay. It was on a weekend which prolly is part of the reason that ruined the fun. Just from the port itself, it was crowded with boats and cruises, which was pretty amazing in a way in how they pushed themselves in and out of the dock. The package tour was not too bad, as meals were included during our boat ride. It was a little hazy that day but I can imagine how beautiful that place once has been. We had couple of stops which included a cave, a bamboo ride, and a quick beach stop. We sat on the beach while the 2 kids are on their swimsuit playing sand castle. I could only imagine how beautiful that place used to be as it is now flooded with tourists and I could barely had a moment of silence to myself. Tourists coming in and out like buzzing bees and instead of sitting there in admiration of the place, I sat there thinking how humans abused nature for money. There are just too many tourists to really appreciate the place and it was impossible to take a picture of the scenery without people in the background. I would say Halong Bay is now overrated.

2D 1N cruise
Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends
A UNESCO world heritage site in northern Vietnam and about 170km away from Hanoi, or 4 hours by car/coach.
A beautiful sea panorama with thousands over limestone islands and islets covering 1,500 sqkm.
The boat is Halong Legeng by Legacy Legend Cruises and has 18 cabins. It starts to cruise out of HaLong and later follow with lunch on boat with quite spread of pork, fish, vegetable and seafood. First activity is swimming and hiking 245 steps to the mid of the hill on Ti Top Island. After that followby afternoon tea with fruits. Learn Viet food cooking about 6:45 pm and follow by dinner.
Next morning the first activity is 6:20am for 15min Taichi excerise by the ship captain. 7:00am is simple breakfast with fruits salad, bread with butter, strawberry and egg, coffee or tea. 7:40am go for cave visit and has to walk up to the cave with 3 chambers. The last chamber is the biggest and the most ineresting up to your own imagination. Later back to the ship and cruise another 2 hours with lunch on board near the port. The cruise end by noon.

Incredible scenery
Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples
One of the most beautiful places in the world to visit with unbelievable views. Don‚Äôt just do a day tour. It isn‚Äôt worth the travel time to get there from Hanoi. Definitely worth staying overnight on one of the cruises to catch the gorgeous pink and orange sunset over the islands.

Such a shame..
Aug 2018
This place is beautiful. The rocks, the formation, the bay. It‚Äôs stunning.

But.. it‚Äôs ruined.
Halong Bay is situated in the North of Tonkin, right near the Chinese border. That means the ‚Äúmorning haze‚Äù that our guide was talking about at 3pm was actually thick air pollution drifting down from China. You could hardly see the rock formations in the distance. I‚Äôd imagine on a clear day, this would look stunning, however, there is then the plastic and other contaminants in the water. Whether from China or Vietnam, who knows but there is a lot of it. The bay is over crowded with boats. The smell of diesel exhaust fumes fills the air. The one and only man made beach is over crowded, filthy and full of jelly fish. Take me back 100 years before humans destroyed this magic place. I was really unimpressed. Don‚Äôt bother.

Ruining a World Heritage Area
Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends
We are on a three day two night Cruise on Ha Long Bay and are having a great time.
Then we noticed one of the boats sweeping rubbish off the bottom deck into the water. COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!!!
This is my fourth visit to this beautiful World Heritage Area, and 20 years ago, we jumped off the boat and swam in the clear water, but wouldn‚Äôt think about it now with all the stuff in the water, bottles, plastic bags, a rubber glove, even a large piece of polystyrene.
The name of the offending boat is V‚ÄôSpirit Classic, we took a photo as we were extremely unhappy about the amount of rubbish in the water, we actually assumed it was the tourists themselves doing the littering, definitely not the boats.
PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS

Overrun by tourists and dirty
Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples
People are offered either a day trip or a 2 day/ 1 night trip on the boat to see Halong Bay.
We did the second option and we went to a beach and did a small hike on the first day and went to see a cave in the second day. Both places were awfully touristy, too crowded, toilets super dirty and discusting and everywhere plastic swimming in the ocean.
Facit:
My advice - don't bother to visit Halong Bay, it's dirty and overrun by tourist boats that spoil the natural environment! It's very sad hopefully the government will take some action here soon.

A magical 2 days tour with Dragon Gold Cruises - and Vanesa from C-vietnam...!
Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples
My husband and I were lucky enough to have won a trip to Hanoi and we were also determined to tick off our Bucket List a wish to visit Ha Long Bay!
We could not have done it without the assistance of Vanesa from C-Vietnam Tours! [Thu Ly Lu'ong] ...Vanesa - you were wonderful...! Your knowledge of both Hanoi [and we will review that at a later stage] and Ha Long Bay, and what was available both time and dollar wise was truly amazing: Your company is sooo lucky to have you honey :-).
Vanesa organised everything for us...all we had to do from our end here in New Zealand, was to provide her with dates when we could travel from our hotel in Hanoi - and what price structure we were looking at: The communication was excellent right the way through and before we go any further - it was such a pleasure to actually meet up with you prior to leaving your beautiful country!
Ha Long Bay! is quite simply - beautiful; before we even got there we had some fun and games with the tour being a little later than usual but this was because the US president - trump - had a motorcade thru Hanoi so all streets were closed: This would have played havoc with both tourists and those travelling to the airport....no matter ....once we were on our way with a busload of 18 we passed through the most intriguing and fascinating countryside. I want more time to do this on the next visit!
We arrived in Ha Long Bay - glorious weather too, and were tendered out to the Dragon Gold Cruise ship....met with drinks and then lunch and finally - on our merry way! A 'league of nations' with 22 different nationalities on board.
Highlights of this 2 day trip included a cooking session, making our own Spring Rolls, a magnificent dinner, visiting the Sung Sot Caves complete with stalactites and stalagmites.. and a looong trek UP and back down again! Again - I would very much like to revisit the caves....a word of warning? do NOT drink a couple beers before doing this trip :-) it's a very long way to the toilets!
Titop Island was the evening visit and in the sunset, sitting on the beach, one had to pinch oneself that we were really truly THERE!
Morning! and what a glorious calm and warm morning! breakfast and off to do some kayaking....LOVED it all...!
A visit to the Pearl Farm [I do love pearls!]....and finally we cruised back to port itself in Ha Long Bay before the 4 hour drive down to Hanoi......
I will include some of the photos taken but the one thing we HAVE to do is say the biggest ever, the 'HUGEST' thank you to Vanesa at C-Vietnam!
Without you and all your assistance, and your knowledge - it would not have been the same!
A thousand thank you's Vanesa and Dragon Gold Cruises for making a dream come true!
