About
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is one of the first museums built in Vietnam by the French. The main building was constructed in 1915. It evokes some motifs of French colonial architecture in the early twentieth century and resembles the image of the Champa temples - towers in Central Viet Nam. 

Visitors will have the opportunity to contemplate more than 400 artifacts on display, including National Treasures and others representing the masterpieces of Champa sculpture in ten centuries (from 5th to 15th). The artifacts were made in a variety of materials, such as sandstone, terracotta, and metal. Grounded in various themes from fertility symbols, deities, mythical animals and architectural decoration from the Hindu and Buddhist, they express the features of cultural and religious values of the Champa people over many generations. 
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is a must-see destination for visitors wishing to discover the culture and heritage of Central Viet Nam.

Could be a better viewing experience
A good museum, with written detail in Vietnamese and English. The only drawback is that there is no air-conditioning. Nor have they provided sufficient fans to create a comfortable viewing experience. There was no provision to even get a bottle of cold water.

Well worth a visit
We spent a couple of hours at the Museum of Cham Sculpture – the Chams are an ethnic minority in Vietnam with a long and interesting history in the region. There were some amazing sculptures on display, with a few dating back to the 3rd century. The audio guide was good. I recommend wandering for a couple of hours.

First day in Da Nang
An unexpected cultural experience, but the best part was having vietnamese school children practice their english on us "Hello, How are you?", "What is your name?". The connections with Hindu India surprised me as well as the size of the collection. Our taxi driver from the airport, adopted us and took us to museums, authentic restaurants and amusement parks. He spoke no english, but with cell phone translation we communicated just fine.

Great Education
The museum is really well set up. The sculptures are quite Amazing and the audio tour provides you with real insight. I could have spent longer there I was quite captivated by the history. It’s an open air museum and the mosquitoes are as bad as anywhere I experienced in Vietnam. Ensure you load up on the heavy duty mosquito repellant s that you don’t have to stress

Best Museum of Cham Art Anywhere
I have to confess that before coming to Vietnam I had never heard of the Cham people or the Champa Empire that lasted from the 2nd century AD until 1832 when its last remnants were absorbed by its Viet neighbours to the north. The Champa Empire was in almost constant conflict with its neighbours and had to fight off repeated invasions from the Viets to the north, the Khmers to the west and the Javanese to the south, not to mention the Mongols a couple of times. Eventually it all became too much and by the 14th century the empire was in irreversible decline and Champa became one of the greatest empires no one has ever heard of. Today there are less than 100,000 people in Vietnam who can still speak the language. The museum was designed and built by the French in 1915 to house a collection of Cham artifacts that had been collected by French archaeologists almost from the time they arrived in Vietnam. The collection of over 300 sandstone and terra cotta works is the largest in the world, housed in ten galleries, each one containing finds from a separate Cham site. The first thing you will notice is that almost all the sculptures depict various Hindu gods and demi-gods, even though Vietnam is thousands of miles rom India. There is also one gallery with Buddhist motifs. Even while Chinawas dominating the north of the country for over a thousand years, in the centre and south the influence was coming from India. I have included quite a few photos of the best pieces including the world's best example of a Gajasimha, a mythical beast that was half elephant and half lion. There's also a frieze showing polo players, just about the last thing I thought I would see in Vietnam. Located just off the Dragon bridge this museum is a must visit in Da Nang.

Fascinating
We took our time going through these exhibits. Good thing we finished before the school field trips and noisy tour groups came. Dear Management, please instruct the teachers NOT to blow their whistle to call the attention of the high school kids. After all, this is a Museum.

Wow! Cham Sculptures in one place
Jan 2023 • Solo
I love museums especially ones with artifacts and sculptures. This is one interesting museum in the heart of Da Nang, just across the Han River. Lots of interesting sculptures to view. The museum contains large collections of Cham sculptures. In spite of all the beautiful sculptures and collections, the place needs to be upgraded/renovated. Many cracks on the walls and appears run down. Hence, my 4 star review.

I couldn't believe how much of the Egypt culture is revealed in the Cham history. This is referring to their clothing, pottery during the same period of time. They also mummified their royalty in the same fashion. Amazing history. You can see the Cham architecture all over Vietnam today..

Stopped here on way to the airport and found the whole experience very interesting. Fascinating to see the many sculptures from the Champa Kingdom. I could happily have spent more time here but as we were due to catch a flight and had a visit to an orphanage to do en route our time was a little limited. Definitely a place to go to in Danang.

Cham Sculpture introduction
Jan 2020 • Friends
A great introduction to Cham history and temple design and sculpture. Make sure to take your smart phone and headphones so you can down the app and listen to the guided tour commentary. A good preparation for a trip to My son.
