Simply delish
Cab a taxi from hotel ( near Han river) for 25dong.
The eatery is situated in a bright alley - walk all the way in. A lot of local and foreigners.
No menu, no order required, just find a table and sit. The staff was super efficient and friendly despite spoke little English.
Find yourself a table; sit and viola!
The staff will bring you the “ standard delish food of screwed porks, a plate of herbs/greens, rice paper, sauce, ban xeo” and together with grilled beef, and beef bun cha noodles. Non beef eater- you can decline the beef bundle.
It was a lovely - tasty “ affordable” meal- importantly not as oily as it looks as I dapped with tissue paper to check on the oil level.
Great choice! Below 130dong without beef dishes. Yes, a satisfied “ feeling full” meal!

Great place
Through a little alley you need to go in order to find it but it’s well worth the reward. Surrounded mainly by locals and a few Korean tourists: the food was extremely good and ridiculously cheap for what we ate. You’re having local food with the locals like the locals, so no table cloth and Gault Milliau but an amazing experience and well filled stomach!

Oily food, poor service
The banh xeo and the beef la lot we ordered as a side were swimming in oil. Service staff, if you can distinguish between them and other customers, are painfully slow and seem to ignore you most of the time. Will not return.

Authentic Banh Xeo
Our first experience of Banh Xeo was at Banh Xeo Ba Duong. At this time, we didn't have any expectations, and had nothing to compare it to. Nonetheless, we still found this place to be authentic, fresh, and mouth watering!!! We had several Banh Xeo's after this one, and nowhere has been anywhere near as good.

Coolest Location Delicious Reputation
The location is easily missed as it’s tucked away down a local alley way, but if you look a bit lost, every local can point you in the right direction.
This place is an automatic must. The atmosphere will make you feel like a local as you sit down and they immediately bring you the best banh xeo in town-it’s all about the sauce.
Prices are great. Food is delicious. Atmosphere is unique. Definitely worth your time.

Apparently this is the best banh xeo in town. Once arrived we were shown to a table and once seated there is no menu, they will just bring the food for the amount of people they see seated. There is some vegetables, some sort of oily pancake with shrimps, pork skewers, sauce, chili, rice paper. All you have to do is to wrap all the stuff yourselves and stuff it into your mouth. If you need to top anything up, just request more. Then they will come to the table to check the empty plates and charge accordingly. Simple, no nonsense and straightforward. Apart from me finding it a tad oily, the meal was delicious.

Worth a visit
Decided to give this place a try. Not straight forward to find but most cab drivers would know this place. Once you take a seat, you will be immediately be served with their signature banh xeo. No doubt, it was delicious. The sauce was the highlight of the dish. One serving is enough for 2-3 people. The price is affordable too. A must visit if you visit Da Nang

Real Food for Real People!
Keeping it real with the best Banh Xeo in Danang! Also known as sizzling cake, this is as good as it gets! The Pork Satay wrapped in rice paper is scrumptious with a load of vegetables. Off the beaten track but yet on track for the best that Vietnam offers!

Best banh xeo in town
This place serves the best banh xeo (fried rice pancake) in town. They also have nem lui (pork meatball on the stick) and grilled beef. All of them are yummy but the best thing is the peanut sauce, they have their secret recipe here. A must-try when you are in Da Nang.

A must go to
I discovered the dish while in the south of Vietnam and really wanted to eat it again. Thanks to TripAdvisor we ended up at this place. And boy o boy, it’s gooood. The alley to get to it is a little shady but not dangerous at all. You sit down and get your food. There was no menu as they only serve that one dish. I loved the freshness of the greens and it tasted so good. I’ve been trying different Vietnamese restaurants while travelling in the UK and Europe since and none compares to this little hidden gem.

He touched the cat!!!!
Worst experience of our lives! We were looking forward to coming here with alot of advisers telling us its a must go restaurant.
We walked in to a full house, but the further we went in filthier it got. There was rubbish all over the floor, kittens running around. Food scraps from previous diners being reused. Staff were unattentive and almost ignored everything we said to them.
To top if off, looking into the kitchen the staff picked her nose as she continued to prepare the food.
What topped it off was that a waiter grabbed the nem sticks from the table.. as he walked back into the kitchen with them waving around in his hand.. he stopped...
My mind was going crazy telling him “do not touch the cat... do not touch the cat.!!”...and then.. “he touched the cat!!!! And picked it up!!”

Amazing food, but a bit smoky in here
Food was amazing. Menu has a few selection but this is a specialty restaurant.
We walked through a narrow alleyway with speeding motorbikes alongside mom-and-pop shops to find the restaurant at the end.
We recommend trying everything including the satay beef which was the most expensive item on the menu. Although the beef was on the drier side, it was still good.

If you look for Banh Xeo in Da Nang..
The this place could be it. It was relatively easy to find it with Google maps and we were not disappointed. The Banh Xeo was really good and the price performance as also ok. Since it was pretty packed we had a table on the 2nd floor (as far as I remember)..
