About
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is one of the first museums built in Vietnam by the French. The main building was constructed in 1915. It evokes some motifs of French colonial architecture in the early twentieth century and resembles the image of the Champa temples - towers in Central Viet Nam. 

Visitors will have the opportunity to contemplate more than 400 artifacts on display, including National Treasures and others representing the masterpieces of Champa sculpture in ten centuries (from 5th to 15th). The artifacts were made in a variety of materials, such as sandstone, terracotta, and metal. Grounded in various themes from fertility symbols, deities, mythical animals and architectural decoration from the Hindu and Buddhist, they express the features of cultural and religious values of the Champa people over many generations. 
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is a must-see destination for visitors wishing to discover the culture and heritage of Central Viet Nam.

Lots of cultural artifacts from the Cham Dynasty and antiques to admire in various exhibition rooms. Our tour guide told us the Sculptures were created from sandstones , terracotta and metal from 5th to 15 Centuries.

Could be a better viewing experience
A good museum, with written detail in Vietnamese and English. The only drawback is that there is no air-conditioning. Nor have they provided sufficient fans to create a comfortable viewing experience. There was no provision to even get a bottle of cold water.

Well worth a visit
We spent a couple of hours at the Museum of Cham Sculpture – the Chams are an ethnic minority in Vietnam with a long and interesting history in the region. There were some amazing sculptures on display, with a few dating back to the 3rd century. The audio guide was good. I recommend wandering for a couple of hours.

First day in Da Nang
An unexpected cultural experience, but the best part was having vietnamese school children practice their english on us "Hello, How are you?", "What is your name?". The connections with Hindu India surprised me as well as the size of the collection. Our taxi driver from the airport, adopted us and took us to museums, authentic restaurants and amusement parks. He spoke no english, but with cell phone translation we communicated just fine.

Great Education
The museum is really well set up. The sculptures are quite Amazing and the audio tour provides you with real insight. I could have spent longer there I was quite captivated by the history. It’s an open air museum and the mosquitoes are as bad as anywhere I experienced in Vietnam. Ensure you load up on the heavy duty mosquito repellant s that you don’t have to stress

Best Museum of Cham Art Anywhere
I have to confess that before coming to Vietnam I had never heard of the Cham people or the Champa Empire that lasted from the 2nd century AD until 1832 when its last remnants were absorbed by its Viet neighbours to the north. The Champa Empire was in almost constant conflict with its neighbours and had to fight off repeated invasions from the Viets to the north, the Khmers to the west and the Javanese to the south, not to mention the Mongols a couple of times. Eventually it all became too much and by the 14th century the empire was in irreversible decline and Champa became one of the greatest empires no one has ever heard of. Today there are less than 100,000 people in Vietnam who can still speak the language. The museum was designed and built by the French in 1915 to house a collection of Cham artifacts that had been collected by French archaeologists almost from the time they arrived in Vietnam. The collection of over 300 sandstone and terra cotta works is the largest in the world, housed in ten galleries, each one containing finds from a separate Cham site. The first thing you will notice is that almost all the sculptures depict various Hindu gods and demi-gods, even though Vietnam is thousands of miles rom India. There is also one gallery with Buddhist motifs. Even while Chinawas dominating the north of the country for over a thousand years, in the centre and south the influence was coming from India. I have included quite a few photos of the best pieces including the world's best example of a Gajasimha, a mythical beast that was half elephant and half lion. There's also a frieze showing polo players, just about the last thing I thought I would see in Vietnam. Located just off the Dragon bridge this museum is a must visit in Da Nang.

Fascinating
We took our time going through these exhibits. Good thing we finished before the school field trips and noisy tour groups came. Dear Management, please instruct the teachers NOT to blow their whistle to call the attention of the high school kids. After all, this is a Museum.

Too warm for a visit at the museum
Jul 2018 • Friends
There was no air con. Plenty of fans but they did not switch them on especially on 2nd floor. Imagine it was 36c hot day indoor with no aircon nor fans. They collected entrance fee yet not providing visitors the basic comfort to slowly enjoy the displays. We quickly walked through the whole museum without spending time to appreciate each item. Needs to improve in order to attract more visitors.

Very privileged to have 2 University students (Loan and her friend) offer to show me around and explain the exhibits. Thank You. Got to appreciate the Cham history and culture. Also fortunate that a photography exhibition on display at the same time illustrating the surrounding Provinces and towns / villages which I wouldn't have the time to explore myself. Thoroughly recommend a visit.

It motivated me to find out more about Cham culture and Vietnam's past.
May 2018
The museum is full of charming sculptures, some touching, other humorous (or interpreted as such by me - not understanding the cultural background). I liked a bass-relief of a polo game - in Vietnam, many centuries ago! The depiction of an elephant-god made me smile - elephant head with human body. I wish I had had more time to enjoy. Perhaps not a destination on its own, but if you are in the vicinity, it's well worth a few hours.

If You Have An Hour to Kill

If you have an hour or two to kill, sure. It has some nice sculptures and photographs, but not a must visit site. Its location is just across the street from the Dragon Bridge.

If you are not a history or archeological person then you might not enjoy it. But there is wordings below every statue so it is easy to understand the meaning of each statue.

A morning well spent, museum is on the edge of town, by the iconic Dragon bridge. The building was the former historic Ecole Francaise d’ Extreme-Orient beautifully conserved. we walk here from the town center. Exhibit are text are bilingual in English & Vietnamese.
