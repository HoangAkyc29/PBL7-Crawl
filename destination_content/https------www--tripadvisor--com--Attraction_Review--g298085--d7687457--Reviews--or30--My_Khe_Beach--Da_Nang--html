A nice sandy beach but...
My Khe Beach is a really nice beach with soft & white sand, temperate waves. There are several food and beverage options along the scenic walkway. Maybe because the beach is close the city centre with lots of hotels & residential nearby, it is too crowded...

Nice beach
The beach is kept clean and the water is crystal clear. There are also plenty of great restaurants nearby, making it easy to enjoy a delicious meal after a day of sun and sand. My Khe Beach is a great place to spend a day or two, and I highly recommend it.

Pretty beach on the DaNang shoreline.
Clean white sand beach with palm trees and mild waves. Picturesque panoramic view showing SonTra mountain awaits for shutterbugs. Beach usually crowded around 5pm after it cools down some.

Beach life at its best
Beautiful beach. We were staying in one of the hotels facing the beach and every moment was mesmerizing. Beautiful sunset with people hitting the water as early as 5.30, exercising, aerobics, zumba classes and more. In the evening with all the lights coming on and the food stalls, option to rent chairs and just making sand art in the clean sand - just wonderful. Life guards are always available and flags are raised to indicate when it's not safe for a swim.

The best city beach of Vietnam!
The best city beach of Vietnam! Really big and very clean (unlike other beaches). Here it is enough place for everyone, so no crowds. Luckily this part of beach os not popular among Vietnamese, so there are no people shouting karaoke, no smelly food and garbage. Comparing with other Da Nang beaches, this one is more developed with some bars and restaurants on the beach. It is really calm and peaceful atmosphere here. Highly recommend!

Beautiful and long beach
My Khe is the central beach of Da Nang city. It's a long and sandy beach, pretty wide. Many hotels line it, just across a busy street. There're many free parts, as well some where's a bar and where you can rent sunbeds. Water is shallow for long, usually with waves. Try to get up early one day before sunrise, as the beach is east oriented. Apart beautiful scenery of the rising sun, you'll enjoy many locals around swimming, practicing tai-chi, jogging, exercising.

Lovely quiet long stretch of sandy beach! May be we came off season. It was really nice and quiet. The wind cool. Great to just chill. Refreshments sold along the beach.

Beautiful beach - the China Beach of the Vietnam era
Nov 2019
I stopped here while in the Da Nang area. The beach is really beautiful and huge. The views from the beach looking out toward the water are also lovely. I had heard about this place, having grown up in the Vietnam era and was very pleased to be able to stop to see it and take a walk around.

Fantastic Beach
Jan 2020 • Solo
Stayed directly opposite this beach. Clean. Nice breeze (get a balcony facing the ocean). Activities early morning and at sunset. Lots of people out and about. Lots of people swimming, walking etc.

Beautiful and relaxing
Apr 2022 • Family
I’ve read some articles claiming My Khe beach is among top 10 beaches of the world. I can’t tell for sure but it’s definitely a long stunning beach.
Some sorts of entertainment as known as water sports are also available such as jet-skiing, para sailing, wake boarding, banana boat ride (this one is funny as hell), speed boat for rent…
Perfect landscape. You get to see Son Tra peninsula with big mountains and the Lady Buddha statue on the left side of the beach. Also you will see the big city with tall buildings on the right side.

If you like cranes and high rises looming over a beach you can't even swim at, this is for you.
Jan 2020
Way too commercial- not any shade to be found other than paid lounge chairs and umbrellas. Lined with huge buildings, a busy road and lots of construction in sight. It's ok if all you want is to look at the waves and go for a walk near the sea, but definitely not a 'relaxing' and natural beach environment. Do not come to Da Nang for the beaches. Better of going to some southern islands or Thailand!

Good for walking but no swimming
Dec 2022 • Couples
Nice long beach to walk along. Clean and peaceful in December.
Could not find an area to swim as it was too dangerous with the waves. Red no swimming flags displayed all along the beach. Nice to paddle. A lot of people have been taken out to sea by the waves over the last few years so be careful.

I stopped here for abit of sun baking and it's a nice peaceful quiet beach. I liked it much more then the one in Hoi An. But did not swim as it wasn't warm enough and heard can be dangerous in some areas with currents.

my khe beach
Feb 2023
Gorgeous beach in Da Nang. The sand is soft and fine, there are plenty of seashells, gentle waves for swimming and wading, lots of spots along the way for a drink or a beach chair under the shade. Lifeguards watch the swimming areas. Great views up and down the beach.

Awesome beach. Very clean and nice beach. A lot of restaurant restaurants and hotels along the beach. My Khe beach is surrounded by fine white sand, temperate waves, year-round warm water. This has created the irresistible beauty of this beach.
