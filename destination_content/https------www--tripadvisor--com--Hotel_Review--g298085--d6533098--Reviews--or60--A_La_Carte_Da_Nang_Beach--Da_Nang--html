Not coming back
A La Carte was one of my favorite hotels when visiting Danang. Had previously stayed back in 2017 & 2019 and had a wonderful experience in the past. I decided to give it another try. Unfortunately, my family had mixed experiences during the check-in process. In my case, a friendly bellman greeted me, and the gentleman at the reception desk did a great job getting me checked in. At that time, I did provide my entire family's documents to confirm our check-in process. However, my wife, a local to Danang, did experience a different level of hospitality upon entering the building that I, unfortunately, had to witness primarily by the bellman not allowing her to even hit the elevator area without speaking with the front desk. She attempted to explain to them that she was already‚Ä¶

Excellent hotel and service
Had a great experience at this hotel. The room was excellent and the ocean view amazing. The staff go out of their way to help with all your needs. Used the Spa while there and had the best massage ever. Vietnamese massage is so good and Ngoc made me so relaxed. Highly recommend

Hotel assumes all guests are busy stealing the silverware and misleading listing
We had a Highlight Plus 2 bedroom apartment with the kitchenette including induction stove and microwave (on Booking.com it also explicitly includes cutlery, crockery and cookware but says nothing either way on the hotel's own website). CONS As a whole the hotel treats guests like they're theives. Imagine our surprise when the kitchenette isn't equipped with ANYTHING except 4 coffee cups and teaspoons. It somewhat defeats the purpose. Apparently these were available at an additional charge üò° You need to sign for towels at the pool and on checkout they also charged us for 2 large bottles of water from the mini bar - no such bottles wete there when we arrived. It wasn't worth my breath to fight it beyond the initial round of disagreement. Additionally the rooms need drastically‚Ä¶

4 nights turned into 2 weeks
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ala Carte. We initially booked a 4 nights stay but ended up extending it to two weeks. The location is perfect for long walks on the beach and exploring. The rooms are significantly larger than standard hotels, spotlessly clean, and very comfortable. We had stayed here in a vacation rental in the past and I have to say the quality and cleanliness of booking through the hotel is far superior. Breakfast is fresh with excellent and wide ranging selections. Best of all, the staff are very customer focused. We especially appreciated Bao, Ngoc, and Giang, the bellmen, who were always genuinely kind, helpful, and made us feel very welcomed. Highly recommended.

Perfect location Perfect property
We have just returned home to Perth from a stay in Da Nang. Thanks to the A La Carte staff and general comfort of this hotel made our visit to Vietnam so much more enjoyable. The only thing to be carefull of when booking are rooms with city view actually look out onto a building being constructed next door. Buffet breakfast a fantastic variety and choise for asian or western cuisine in a spacious and well set out restaurant.

Large Oceanside rooms
Hotel is full of Large spacious clean rooms. Suggest to take 2 bedroom apartment if with kids. Location also good, just opposite the ocean. My family had a great time each morning playing with the ocean tides. Me being vegan, had a tough time in breakfast. Need to improve vegan items in menu. Also kids play area very small, not really a play area. Swimming pool is good if weather is hot, but not heated in case of cold weather Overall service good.

So-so. Nothing to shout loud for.
Ala Carte location is good and room size is spacious. However, staff at counter isn‚Äôt really friendly but their doormen are really nice. Housekeeping can be improved. There are water strains on the table for days but cleaner did not wipe it off. During our 8 days stay, the strain wasn‚Äôt wiped off. Although there is a kitchenette but no utensils and even drinking glasses provided. Room 1805 condition is a tad run down. Will not stay here if we visit Danang again.
