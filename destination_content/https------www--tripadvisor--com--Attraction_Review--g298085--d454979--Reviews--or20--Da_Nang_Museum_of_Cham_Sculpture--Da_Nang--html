About
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is one of the first museums built in Vietnam by the French. The main building was constructed in 1915. It evokes some motifs of French colonial architecture in the early twentieth century and resembles the image of the Champa temples - towers in Central Viet Nam. 

Visitors will have the opportunity to contemplate more than 400 artifacts on display, including National Treasures and others representing the masterpieces of Champa sculpture in ten centuries (from 5th to 15th). The artifacts were made in a variety of materials, such as sandstone, terracotta, and metal. Grounded in various themes from fertility symbols, deities, mythical animals and architectural decoration from the Hindu and Buddhist, they express the features of cultural and religious values of the Champa people over many generations. 
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is a must-see destination for visitors wishing to discover the culture and heritage of Central Viet Nam.

Could be a better viewing experience
A good museum, with written detail in Vietnamese and English. The only drawback is that there is no air-conditioning. Nor have they provided sufficient fans to create a comfortable viewing experience. There was no provision to even get a bottle of cold water.

Well worth a visit
We spent a couple of hours at the Museum of Cham Sculpture – the Chams are an ethnic minority in Vietnam with a long and interesting history in the region. There were some amazing sculptures on display, with a few dating back to the 3rd century. The audio guide was good. I recommend wandering for a couple of hours.

First day in Da Nang
An unexpected cultural experience, but the best part was having vietnamese school children practice their english on us "Hello, How are you?", "What is your name?". The connections with Hindu India surprised me as well as the size of the collection. Our taxi driver from the airport, adopted us and took us to museums, authentic restaurants and amusement parks. He spoke no english, but with cell phone translation we communicated just fine.

Great Education
The museum is really well set up. The sculptures are quite Amazing and the audio tour provides you with real insight. I could have spent longer there I was quite captivated by the history. It’s an open air museum and the mosquitoes are as bad as anywhere I experienced in Vietnam. Ensure you load up on the heavy duty mosquito repellant s that you don’t have to stress

Best Museum of Cham Art Anywhere
I have to confess that before coming to Vietnam I had never heard of the Cham people or the Champa Empire that lasted from the 2nd century AD until 1832 when its last remnants were absorbed by its Viet neighbours to the north. The Champa Empire was in almost constant conflict with its neighbours and had to fight off repeated invasions from the Viets to the north, the Khmers to the west and the Javanese to the south, not to mention the Mongols a couple of times. Eventually it all became too much and by the 14th century the empire was in irreversible decline and Champa became one of the greatest empires no one has ever heard of. Today there are less than 100,000 people in Vietnam who can still speak the language. The museum was designed and built by the French in 1915 to house a collection of Cham artifacts that had been collected by French archaeologists almost from the time they arrived in Vietnam. The collection of over 300 sandstone and terra cotta works is the largest in the world, housed in ten galleries, each one containing finds from a separate Cham site. The first thing you will notice is that almost all the sculptures depict various Hindu gods and demi-gods, even though Vietnam is thousands of miles rom India. There is also one gallery with Buddhist motifs. Even while Chinawas dominating the north of the country for over a thousand years, in the centre and south the influence was coming from India. I have included quite a few photos of the best pieces including the world's best example of a Gajasimha, a mythical beast that was half elephant and half lion. There's also a frieze showing polo players, just about the last thing I thought I would see in Vietnam. Located just off the Dragon bridge this museum is a must visit in Da Nang.

Fascinating
We took our time going through these exhibits. Good thing we finished before the school field trips and noisy tour groups came. Dear Management, please instruct the teachers NOT to blow their whistle to call the attention of the high school kids. After all, this is a Museum.

Surprisingly Excellent
May 2023 • Couples
We were pleasantly surprised as this museum has plenty that link to Hindu Gods and display Rich Hindu ancient culture.
A must visit I would say.
There is no Aircon so day time visit was a bit uncomfortable and no vending machine inside premises to buy drinks.

Unique Collection in a Lovely Building
The Cham people were the dominant force in Central Vietnam from the 3rd to the 15th century, but they are little known today outside of Vietnam. A non-Vietnamese people (probably arriving from Indonesia) the Cham were heavily influenced by Indian civilization and Hindu/Buddhist religion. Their culture, art and architecture were quite different from the Chinese-influenced Vietnamese, who eventually overran them. Today there are probably less than 100,00 self-identified Cham people in Vietnam (and they are mostly now Muslim). Other remaining Cham communities are concentrated in Cambodia
The Cham museum in Danang has incomparably the best collection anywhere of Cham materials, mostly sculptures. This remarkable and beautiful collection is housed in a fine open-plan museum building, with cooling breezes blowing in through open windows. Very much worth a visit (this can be done as an easy day-trip if you'fre staying in Hoi An).

A bit underwhelming
Apr 2023 • Family
This is not a museum of a huge size. When Cham site My Son was discovered by French, they brought all important Artefacts to this purposely built place. There is some explanation in 3 languages. Luckily we had our tour guide to inject a bit more life to the exposition

If you don't know the history of the area this could be interesting. I have seen statues and historical items that didn't bring me any strong emission, as it seem very repetitive on items exposition.
I wouldn't suggested to go, neither if was a rainy day. Insufficient as personal feedback (2.5/5 marks)

Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture.
Strongly recommended as a place to visit in Da Nang and situated to the southern side of the downtown. Entrance fee is 20,000 Dong. The building in which the exhibits housed is itself worth visiting although maintenance could be improved. Inside the building there is no air conditioning so although the ceiling are high the building in the middle of the day tends to be hot and stuffy. That said the exhibits are well presented and the narrative more often than not is in English as well as Vietnamese. At various points around the museum there are laminated A4 cards explaining the background to the exhibits in that particularly part of the musuem.
There is a souvenir and gift shop before the exit. Allow around 1 hour for viewing the display.

Glorious past of Cham culture
Sep 2012 • Couples
I was feeling like i am in ancient Hindu temple surround by gods. It is one of the best museums in Vietnam visited by me. It is having a great collection of Sculpture related to cham culture. Most of the sculptures are well preserve. Only thing missing was the detailed information about sculpture.
Must give 4-5 hour,if want to see it properly.

Gigantic collection
Aug 2019 • Business
If you're into arts, cultures, and history, or if you just want a great location for your photo shooting, Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is a highly recommended place to visit! The museum is located near the Dragon Bridge on the tail side and the entran fee is 60,000 VND each. It is closed at 5.30pm. The old light yellow building and surrounded beautiful trees can really comfort us.
The great collection simply make us stunned whennwe enter the exhibition sections. Descriptions and explanations are QR coded and 🎧 guided headsets are available as well.
Although the exhibition rooms and halls are rather warm, the displayed sculptures are truely amazing.
Da Nang has three close ancient cities which also include My Son where day tours can be arranged.
This museum is the largest Cham sculpture collection in the world. This 's another reason you shouldn't miss it and need at least 2 hours to appreciate and of course learn a lot of history here.

Very disappointing
Mar 2017 • Couples
Museum is in dire need of a rehab, outer gates and walls are crumbling and paint chips are piling up. The displays are weathered and dirty, it is a very important site containing the early history of the Cham people, it is in dire need of a renovation and better preservation of the artifacts. Good historical content set in a poorly displayed setting. Historic village of My Son is a much better presentation of the Cham people.
