Amazing experience! Wished we stayed longer
We had an amazing time. The staff were so lovely and helpful. Especially Linh Chi, she was very attentive in serving us and taking great group photos - we really appreciate it. Bruce Panda was very informative on our small boat rides to the cruise and activities.

Paradise on La Casta Cruise
We were incredibly lucky to have the VIP suite on our trip. Our room included a whirlpool bath and our very own sauna.

The food was divine. Especially the evening meal, which was enjoyed with some wonderful cocktails.
We used our time to thoroughly relax on board, but others did go on the canoes and reported to have enjoyed their experience.

Lovely Experience.
You‚Äôll need lots of storage for your photos, the scenery is quite spectacular.
The cruise staff and accommodation were outstanding, extremely friendly. The cabins are fabulous with little balconies.
The selection of food was also delicious. Drinks were charged separately and as you‚Äôd expect from any cruise were rather expensive.
I would recommend the 2 night cruise as on the 1 night cruise you do not board until the afternoon and then dock again the next morning.

Exotic cruise and a beautiful place to stay. Hallong Bay is itself a beautiful place with rich natural beauty. Cruise had made the trip even more exotic and luxurious.
Thanks to Travellia from CCU India, for arranging the same.
We stayed only for 1 night but atleast a 2night stay was required.
Food displayed was super tasty. Drinks served were also excellent.

Top class service & exceptional private chauffeur
We hired a vehicle and driver from this company for 3 days and 2 night. The customer service and communication was exceptional.
I took my mother back to her hometown in Mong Cai and we were allocated a driver name Mr Hoan. (110% recommend this man)
The car met us at Ha Long, where we were in full communication the whole time. We didn‚Äôt feel unsafe or misled in anyway. Mr Hoan drove my family and I all the way to Mong Cai. He made many pit stops for us as I was travelling with small children. He made us feel like we were all a family. Was not awkward at all, very professional and easy going. Amazing customer service. We felt great to have a driver take us everywhere. Very grateful for Mr Hoan for providing great service and was our personal chauffeur for the few days.

Fantastic Team
The Halong Bay Tour is Amazing. But it won't be as Amazing as it supposed to be, if without the effort from Mr Hung and his team's extraordinary contributions. We all have an unforgettable memory tour in the bay, and we all enjoy the last day of 2023 and the first day of 2024, with all the champagne and firework in the boat. Definitely will return and come back to this Tour again.

Super impressed!
My entire family had an absolutely brilliant stay here. We were particularly impressed with the quality of service, the standard of rooms and the food. The staff really went out of their way to satisfy my vegetarian requirements, too.
The itinerary was also very good.
Upon arrival, we decided to upgrade to the president suite as it was available. Totally worth it!
As a family we are not keen on cruises but this certainly exceeded our expectations. Would we consider a family holiday on a cruise in the future? After this experience.... Possibly! üòÅ

Hands down, a perfect day in Halong Bay
If you are in hanoi or halong bay you have to book a day with LA Casta. From start to finish, it's a perfect trip. The food, the views, the staff, the tourguides( Duk is the man!), all perfection. The only complaint I have is it had to end. I've worked in the boat related tourist industry for years, and these people are second to none.

Wonderful overnight cruise
Earlier reviews of Ha Long Bay itself mention trash. I was very pleased to see barely any trash once we got away from the port area. Single-use plastics have been banned for some time now, which will have helped enormously.
Anyway, to our trip... from our pick-up at Hanoi Opera on an extremely comfortable minibus to when we were dropped back there the following day, we thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.
The staff were excellent. The boat has 22 cabins and was full, I think. Each cabin has a private balcony, where you can sit and enjoy the views. There was a corner jacuzzi in our cabin, which would be nice if you go in winter.
There were only 5 Westerners onboard, but both the boat manager and assistant manager spoke very good English and made sure that all announcements were made in English as well as Vietnamese.
The other staff were also excellent and the service of a high standard. The food was good and plentiful - a bit too plentiful, actually. We felt guilty at having to leave so much of what was put on our table. An earlier review mentioned lack of drinking water. Perhaps that comment was acted on, as there was free drinking water with all meals, on the launch for trips off of the boat, and there to greet us when we returned from them.
The short trips off the boat are all worth doing as long as you know what to expect. The trip to Surprising Cave was our favourite. The cave is massive and the lighting shows off the features well. The kayaking is for only a short time around a small bay, which was crowded with other kayakers. The 'bamboo boat' option around the same small bay was not on bamboo boats, just large rowing boats. The swimming trip is to a small man-made beach, but it was lovely to get into the water to cool off.
My daughter enjoyed the karaoke in the evening, which had lots of Western songs to choose from. However, the best thing of all was sitting up on the top deck, sipping a G&T and watching the incredible sunset.

Wonderful Trip
Took this cruise ship in Ha Long Bay for a one night cruise. Events were well-planned, food was amazing and creatively presented, and the crew were top-notch! Extremely comfortable beds and rooms. Highly recommend!!!
