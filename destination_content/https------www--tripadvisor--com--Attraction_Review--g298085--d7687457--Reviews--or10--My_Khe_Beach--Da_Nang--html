A nice sandy beach but...
My Khe Beach is a really nice beach with soft & white sand, temperate waves. There are several food and beverage options along the scenic walkway. Maybe because the beach is close the city centre with lots of hotels & residential nearby, it is too crowded...

Nice beach
The beach is kept clean and the water is crystal clear. There are also plenty of great restaurants nearby, making it easy to enjoy a delicious meal after a day of sun and sand. My Khe Beach is a great place to spend a day or two, and I highly recommend it.

Pretty beach on the DaNang shoreline.
Clean white sand beach with palm trees and mild waves. Picturesque panoramic view showing SonTra mountain awaits for shutterbugs. Beach usually crowded around 5pm after it cools down some.

Beach life at its best
Beautiful beach. We were staying in one of the hotels facing the beach and every moment was mesmerizing. Beautiful sunset with people hitting the water as early as 5.30, exercising, aerobics, zumba classes and more. In the evening with all the lights coming on and the food stalls, option to rent chairs and just making sand art in the clean sand - just wonderful. Life guards are always available and flags are raised to indicate when it's not safe for a swim.

The best city beach of Vietnam!
The best city beach of Vietnam! Really big and very clean (unlike other beaches). Here it is enough place for everyone, so no crowds. Luckily this part of beach os not popular among Vietnamese, so there are no people shouting karaoke, no smelly food and garbage. Comparing with other Da Nang beaches, this one is more developed with some bars and restaurants on the beach. It is really calm and peaceful atmosphere here. Highly recommend!

Beautiful and long beach
My Khe is the central beach of Da Nang city. It's a long and sandy beach, pretty wide. Many hotels line it, just across a busy street. There're many free parts, as well some where's a bar and where you can rent sunbeds. Water is shallow for long, usually with waves. Try to get up early one day before sunrise, as the beach is east oriented. Apart beautiful scenery of the rising sun, you'll enjoy many locals around swimming, practicing tai-chi, jogging, exercising.

Long stretch!
Lovely quiet long stretch of sandy beach! May be we came off season. It was really nice and quiet. The wind cool. Great to just chill. Refreshments sold along the beach.

This is a beautiful beach even December/January.
But, the beach is not so clean to swim owing to gray water.
Wind is cool, making person relax.

The one thing that i desire is there is no restaurant to eat, deliciously.

Clean, beautiful beach
Feb 2020 • Friends
This is a Gold Coast-like beach. Vast, clean and beautiful. Lifeguards on duty and they were very attentive. You can hire canopies and lazy chairs here. They don’t allow picnics and food so the beach stays rubbish-free.

Nice beach for a relaxing day
Mar 2020
It's a nice, large beach. It was very quiet in March I'm guessing because of the corona virus but it was even better for us. There is nice cafes and shops across the busy road and a little beach bars where you can get refreshments. The beach was fairly clean as well which is a plus.

How to ruin a good beach.
Apr 2023 • Couples
I was very disappointed with the way this beach is over- managed. The life guards squeeze everyone into a very narrow section which make for an unnecessarily crowded experience and limits swimming and a sense of freedom. I would not stay here again.

AS GOOD AS A TOWN BEACH GETS....
Feb 2020 • Family
Contrary to certain other reviews, I found this beach to be pretty clean, and there wasn't much here that I could moan about.
In fact, my nine year old, insisted that she would enjoy a swim, especially if there were big breakers, between four and six every evening during our stay, and normally, to my chagrin, pulling me into the sea as well.
Safety would seem to be a big thing here, with about twenty or si lifeguards....

Nov 2019 • Solo
I am lucky to be staying in a Hotel located in My Khe beach. It is a long, sandy beach where you can swim without any problem. There are many amenities, restaurants and cafeterias on the ledge. In the evening, I went for a long walk on my khe beach while admiring the sunset

Beautiful Beach
There are two seasons in Vietnam, hot and hotter. Cooling in the ocean around Da Nang is welcome relieve. This soft sand beach was soooooo long and can accommodate many, many people. Sparse crowd during day we visited. Didn’t see any lifeguards. Watch for riptides.

a wonderful sandy beach
Dec 2022
It is unfortunate that we visited My Khe Beach in December so swimming was out of the question. However we enjoyed a stroll along the promenade and admired the beautiful sandy beach. By the beach there were many cafes and restaurants as well as a small temple and basket boats, but the sea was too rough to see any of them in the water.

We visited the beach in December and hardly anyone was at the beach. I loved that it was nearly empty and you could enjoy your time in peace unlike in the overcrowded European beaches. The beach was very very clean, no trash or seaweed in sight. The water was quite warm. White sandy beach.
