Halong có thể nói là điểm đến số 1 việt nam. Đến đây mới thấy được tại sao du khách quốc tế không bao giờ bỏ qua nơi này. Không gian đẹp mà không từ ngữ nào có thể mô tả được mà nó chỉ có thể cảm nhận qua các giác quan khi bạn có cơ hội trải nghiệm.

Điểm thăm quan tuyệt vời
Hạ Long thực sự là môt điểm thăm quan đẹp đến hiếm có. Cảnh sắc quá tuyệt vời. Tạo hóa thật khéo khi mà lớp lớp các hòn nằm rải rác khắp nơi, còn du thuyền đi đi vào các hẻm. Tạo nên một không gian như tiên cảnh.
Đây là một điểm thăm quan không thể bỏ lỡ. Nếu bạn có điều kiên thì nên ngủ đêm ở trên Vịnh.

Nơi tuyệt vời
thg 1 năm 2021
Vịnh Hạ Long ở Việt Nam là một trong những quần thể đá vôi lớn nhất và ấn tượng nhất trên thế giới. Nếu bạn có ý định thực hiện một tour du lịch qua vịnh, bạn nên chọn các tour du lịch 2-3 ngày. Bạn nên dành thời gian để thưởng ngoạn phong cảnh, bước lên một số hòn đảo. Đặc biệt bạn nên thuê tầu ngủ đêm trên Vịnh. Đây sẽ là một trải nghiệm khó quên trong cuộc đời

Rất đẹp.
Phong cảnh núi non hùng vĩ, bao la, rộng lớn.
Cả nhà mua vé du thuyền ra thăm động Thiên Cung cũng khá đẹp. Nhưng động Thiên Đường ở Quảng Bình có lẽ đẹp hơn ở đây. Sẽ quay lại khi có dịp.

Cánh đẹp nhưng quá bẩn
Cánh sắc ở Hạ Long so với nước khác thật sự là quá hùng vĩ, xứng dang di sản thiên nhiên, nhưng vấn đề vệ sinh đã làm mất đi vẻ đẹp của vịnh. Nước trong vịnh quá bẩn và quá nhiều rác thải. Thu phí vé vào rất cao nhưng việc bảo vệ môi trường chỉ làm hình thức, cấm khách mang đồ nhựa 1 lần vào Vịnh nhưng trong Vịnh các của hàng buôn bán lại sử dụng rất nhiều nhựa 1 lần. Thất vọng

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

We found HALONG BAY CRUISE HUNTERS agent on TripAdvisor with real reviews for cruise, and it was so exciting trip with all inclusive package, but alcohol drinks not included, we paid extra fee for wine, cocktails, i think this is same policy for all boats here in Halong. Overall, the experience was great, even it was slightly cold during our time in Halong Bay.
