A must stop in Pleiku
If you are in Pleiku this is a good stop to get a feel for the locals who are quite proud of this place of worship.

I have no idea what to make of this place
I came alone and only knew a little about this cemetery. There were three curators, one of which could speak English. They were all very friendly and insisted I sit with them in the shade to have a chat and some water. Then the two that spoke no English showed me around so that I could take photos. One of them had a wallet filled with photos of the unborn children that rested in the graves - these were hard to look at but I felt obliged. Afterwards I walked around by myself to take some photos.

All in all it's worth a visit.

Limited Appeal
If you served at Camp Holloway during the Viet Nam conflict, it is healing to see the site but there is not much left - bit of the former air strip. A Vietnamese Military facility covers most of the area of Holloway so we traveled pubic roads around that facility to find through neighborhoods to find a the airstrip.
