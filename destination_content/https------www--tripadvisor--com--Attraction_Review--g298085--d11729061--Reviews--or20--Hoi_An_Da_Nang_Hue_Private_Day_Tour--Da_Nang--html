Tour guide, Vu is very knowledgeable, providing interesting information with his good command of English. The entire 4-day tour was very enjoyable and well arranged.

Loved the cycling experience, basket boat tour and cooking class. The food tour at Hoi An old town was insightful too.
He is very patient and helpful.

Private tour to Bana/ Golden Bridge
Apr 2022 • Couples
We are living in Da Nang city and decided to book the private tour to Bana/ Golden hand bridge with Vu. I highly recommend doing this because without tour guide you will miss lot of things. Vu was very friendly and easy-going, along the road to the site he introduced and explained about local lives and culture, it was very lucky to have him because we learned a lot during the ride. Then, Vu helped us get the cable car ticket and took pictures on the bridge for us with no doubt. Then we walked through flower garden, wine cellar, and some temples on the top, Vu was patient to explain everything to us and once again, help us take very nice pictures, we finished the tour by driving back to hotel
I can’t recommend enough Vu as a private guide and his service. If you need a guide, Vu definitely the man. Thanks

Awesome trip with Mr. Vu
It was a very awesome trip with our guide(Mr. Vu). We covered Hoi An, Pagoda and BaNa hills. Ba Na hills is a very good hill station. Mr. Vu has a good grip on history and spoke good English. He has lots of patience and showed all the places. He was letting the trip to be done at our own pace than his pace. That’s best part.
