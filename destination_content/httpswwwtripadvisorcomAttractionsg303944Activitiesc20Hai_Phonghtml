The good bar, quite ok
The Good Bar was located at the center of the island where there were many tourists would stop and stay. In The good bar, we ordered French fries, Vietnamese style Banh mi and local beers for out late lunch at 2 AM. Food was normal, there was nothing special about it. Local beer was cheap, 20k VND for a small cup 350ml and 30k VND for a bigger cup 650ml. They kept playing old pop songs. It was a ok place for lunch.
In the evening, When I was there, the first floor of the bar was full of people. So I went to 3rd floor. The 2nd floor was crazy and hot like hell. I saw some backpack guys were sleeping there. I entered to the room, I saw them, I laughed, they laughed and I left. It was not a floor to have a drink. The 3rd floor of the bar was totally different than the 1st floor. They played loud music. Everybody was drinking, laughing and some of them were using some kind of laughing balloon. I ordered a ....huge local beer. The music was not so bad. The view from the 3rd floor was nice.

New owners and location, but not improved
Now under new ownership and located at 96 Van Cao. Too small, too smoky, too loud to recommend. Nothing to special to suggest it. Better options exist.
