A nice sandy beach but...
My Khe Beach is a really nice beach with soft & white sand, temperate waves. There are several food and beverage options along the scenic walkway. Maybe because the beach is close the city centre with lots of hotels & residential nearby, it is too crowded...

Nice beach
The beach is kept clean and the water is crystal clear. There are also plenty of great restaurants nearby, making it easy to enjoy a delicious meal after a day of sun and sand. My Khe Beach is a great place to spend a day or two, and I highly recommend it.

Pretty beach on the DaNang shoreline.
Clean white sand beach with palm trees and mild waves. Picturesque panoramic view showing SonTra mountain awaits for shutterbugs. Beach usually crowded around 5pm after it cools down some.

Beach life at its best
Beautiful beach. We were staying in one of the hotels facing the beach and every moment was mesmerizing. Beautiful sunset with people hitting the water as early as 5.30, exercising, aerobics, zumba classes and more. In the evening with all the lights coming on and the food stalls, option to rent chairs and just making sand art in the clean sand - just wonderful. Life guards are always available and flags are raised to indicate when it's not safe for a swim.

The best city beach of Vietnam!
The best city beach of Vietnam! Really big and very clean (unlike other beaches). Here it is enough place for everyone, so no crowds. Luckily this part of beach os not popular among Vietnamese, so there are no people shouting karaoke, no smelly food and garbage. Comparing with other Da Nang beaches, this one is more developed with some bars and restaurants on the beach. It is really calm and peaceful atmosphere here. Highly recommend!

Beautiful and long beach
My Khe is the central beach of Da Nang city. It's a long and sandy beach, pretty wide. Many hotels line it, just across a busy street. There're many free parts, as well some where's a bar and where you can rent sunbeds. Water is shallow for long, usually with waves. Try to get up early one day before sunrise, as the beach is east oriented. Apart beautiful scenery of the rising sun, you'll enjoy many locals around swimming, practicing tai-chi, jogging, exercising.

Nice sand
Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Long stretch of beach with very find sand. Water is not calm for those looking for that. Shallow waters with waves. No beach bars on the beach in the An Thurong area except for the Apocalypse. They have live music there. Beach chairs are inexpensive...40k. The water is warm.

Great beach! Lovely sand and gentle surf. Highly recommended
Mar 2020
I've just returned from a motorcycle trip which ended at the beach in Da Nang and WOW, what a lovely beach! With the current virus scare, I found the beach almost empty, which is incredible!
I didn't see any evidence of litter, in fact its one of the cleanest beaches I've visited for many years.
I did try surfing, but the waves were a little too small on that day.
I'd have no hesitation in visiting this lovely beach again!

Very big one and beautiful too... Well maintained and not many people visiting. The breeze under the coconut tree shades makes it a pleasure. Carry on food if planning for day long stay, which should be a breeze too ...

Peaceful, clean beach with white sand and clear blue water. Great for a relaxing time as it‚Äôs not too busy. Plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby so you can easily spend the whole day here. Shame there wasn‚Äôt any water activities or swimming allowed.

Unlike many beautiful beaches I've been to, this is not packed with people. Also, w felt very safe and did not worry about our belongings being possibly stolen. Locals are friendly and helpful, and we were not hounded by on the beach roaming vendors.

Superb place
May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Best place to stay in Da nang.
Beautiful beach, white sand like silk and was surprised when I saw from my hotel balcony that at 5am hundreds of people were there, swimming, playing games, yoga and what not.
There were yellow flags on beach with proper enclosure and life guards for people who wanted to Amon in Sea.
All good hotels are lined along the beach and good nightlife and restaurants, very scenic.
A must visit place.

Detailed Assessment of a Nice Beach Area
May 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo
I've spent 2 weeks overlooking this long beach, walking it's prominade every day, and taking several swims. Here's some details for those visiting the city for a few days or deciding whether to visit this city based upon its beach holiday potential.

The curve of long sand stretching along the entire coast east of the city really is attractive, both from the ground and from one of the many high rises east of the river. The sand is soft, light tan, and extensive enough to allow a person to walk miles north or south. In May, the water's been neither cold nor warm, but pleasant enough to swim in comfortably. The moderate waves make for fun surf but don't completely prohibit swimming in the deeper waters. The shelf is gradual enough to allow plenty of safe distance for kids and surf play but not too far out to prevent swimming potential. And though the water isn't as impressively clear or gorgeous as Phuket's, it's clear enough to see the rippled sandy bottom and lack of rocks, vegetation, or unpleasant critters. Unfortunately, its also easy to see a good bit of trash floating in the water and surf. What a shame.
The beach has multiple designated swimming areas that are roped off, flagged, and manned with ineffective yellow shirt / red short life guards. There are a few red signed areas designated as no swimming, and the life guards will chase you out if you happen to be near their presence of a designated swimming area. Otherwise, a large part of the water is neither designated swimming nor prohibited area. During the late sunny mornings and early to mid afternoons, the locals mostly avoid the beach, leaving the few foreignors to enjoy abundant water and sand space. Around 4 pm the locals start descending on the beach, and by 5 pm the designated swimming areas are packed. Still, 2/3rds of the water remains open for those wanting more privacy or open space. In short, it's a long, wide, mostly uncrowded beach with plenty of room to accommodate the city residents and limted number of tourists. That'll change though, as evidenced by the numerous hotel buildings being constructed along the entire coastline and the number of buses already bringing loads of Chinese tourists to the prominade each day, late in the afternoon.
Elsewhere on the sand, there are the usual beach and chair rental spaces for a fair price of 40k VND (about $2), along with drink vendors. The food vendors exist, but they're few in number and quite limited compared to other more developed beaches. There's beach tubes and toys being sold for the kids, colorful kites worth a photo or flight, expensive parasailing rides, and jet ski rentals. What's pleasant is the limited number of beach touts and the negligible number of jet skis racing about - unlike Phuket, Pattaya, or Langkawi. Up on the sand, there's a large designated area for volleyball and other sports activities. Even for those not playing, it makes for interesting viewing since apparently teams come out to practice and some of them are pretty good.
Adjacent to the beach is a really nice prominade lined with palm trees that provide partial shade during the day. I consider this a critical part of the beach's environment that adds to its use and rating. It's long, wide, attractive, and clean, thanks to the continuous labor of city workers and the green culture of the city's residents. Unlike the littering, garbage living slobs I observed next door in Cambodia, people here seem to have a sense of using trash cans instead of throwing all of their waste on the ground. The prominade is also outfitted with a few bathrooms but they are too small and few. Instead, we get music being played via outdoor megaphones. It's a nice thought, but its few number of speakers playing too loud does not create a nice ambience like that at the river prominade. Still, the city's done well to provide a pleasant walking environment by limiting the motorbike parking areas and providing a large number of bench and sitting areas. Surprisingly, there are very few food vendors working the prominade. A few more like Phuket's (overcrowded) Patong Beach would seem appropriate.
On the south end of the beach is a nice, outdoor drink venue established by the adjacent Holiday Beach Hotel. Here, the music is often too loud for normal conversation, but it's consistently a nice mix of American soft rock/pop during the days and live flamingo music being played 6 nights a week at 8 pm. Just south of here is an outdoor gym equipment venue which receives a lot of use in the late afternoon / evenings. While playing on the bars myself, I was impressed with the gymnastics talent being displayed by some of the regulars there. It's worth a watch if you happen to be there at the right time.
In early mornings, there's exercise and activity occurring on the beach, but during most of the day time, the prominade is as empty as the beach area. Most people come out after work, making the place more interesting then. At night, people continue to enjoy the waterfront, sand, and prominade. It's a low key, seemingly safe place with people about, but not crowded - perfect for a sit or a walk.
This beach does not have the white sand, intense aqua marine water, or complete prominade development of a 5 star paradise. It's also degraded by the sound of constant honking horns and adjacent skyline of cranes and construction noise. Still, it's a great assett for the city and worth your time for a visit, be it a day, week, or month.
