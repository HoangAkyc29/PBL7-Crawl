Dangerous and Dirty
Food is very plain, cheap. Location is very underwhelming. I give this place a 1/5 because I got extremely sick after eating here. I wouldn't risk going here despite the price.

Local street food for a quick lunch
We wanted to find some local food and saw this chicken rice place. The chicken is roasted so it's a little dry but outside is crispy. It is served with orange rice (not sure what it is) and a sweet sauce. The place is right next to the road so the environment is not for sitting long. Overall it's a decent place for those who are looking to try some local flavors and a quick lunch, but the trade offs are comfort and the surrounding environment.

Crisp, huge, and filling
Was surprised by the size, got like half a chicken with breast, thigh, leg and wing. Skin was so crispy. And the price is unbelievable

Value for money
Bought a takeaway and turned out that one portion is probably enough to eat for two. The taste of the chicken and rice are great, but we probably would have enjoyed them more if we eat directly at the restaurant itself.

Average local restaurant
It is a local restaurant specialized in com ga(rice with chicken). The price for com ga dish is about 40,000vnd. There were many local customers, and my friend and i were only foreigners(we had a dinner). The restaurant is located besides the road and it is opened; so it was quite noisy while we were eating. Staffs cannot speak English, but they were very kind. I ordered com ga, but the chicken was little bit tough.

Perfect
I love local food in places locals go. This had everything I love. Food was great, the roasted chicken was tender on the inside crispy on the outside, the rice was perfect. Top it off with a great price tag and hilarious staff who tried to teach me the proper Vietnamese enunciation. Can't wait to go back

Chicken for all
We eat here when we come down to Danang, always good chicken and we brought some locals here. They loved it and had never been. While the chicken can be a dry for Western tastes, the cooking does this, but the reward is eating crispy skin. I put some of the broth on my rice for flavor and the sauce makes the chicken a little moistier. So go eat here and enjoy great chicken.

Crispy and tasty chicken.
Local eatery with inexpensive and tasty chicken. The crispy skin is delicious. To me the rice is a bit dry, but that might be because I come from a country where we have sause on everything.

Great Cheap Lunch!
Went here twice for lunch as it was super cheap as well as being very tasty!
Not many options just chicken and rice but options are not needed as that is all you will need to order.. delicious and the crunchy chicken skin is so tasty. For two people to have Fried Chicken and Rice and 2 Cokes it was under 50,000.

The best chicken in Vietnam!
It is a very local reaturant, most of their staff can't speak English but they have a mutli-language menu book. Both the steamed and deep fried chickens are very very delicous. After having lunch here, we even ordered 4 more extra chicken legs to take away back to hotel to enjoy it! It is just so tasty!! Highly recommend!

Finger licking good!
We found this place from a couple of Japanese food bloggers who recommended this place.
Ordering the food wasn’t a problem as the menu was in Vietnamese, English and Japanese and I think the restaurant is famed for their chicken and rice. When my wife suggested chicken and rice, I wasn’t exactly thrilled as when I was younger I used to eat a lot of Hainanese chicken rice and I thought it was going to be much the same.
To my surprised the chicken came fried over a bed of rice and lettuce, tomato and cucumber on the side. The only way to eat the chicken was by hand, however, because it literally came out of the pan, the chicken was too hot to handle! Luckily, they gave you a bowl of watercress soup for starters so that enable the chicken to cool down.
Food wise, the chicken was delicious, the chicken was succulent and the skin was very crisp and best of all was the rice which was very tasty and not dry.
Service very good, the food came right away and on the night we had dinner there, towards the end of the meal, the heavens opened up and poured with rain for at least half an hour. The staff didn’t chase us away which would have been awkward.
Three plates of chicken rice, two Larue beer and a can of Sprite came to just under 170,000VND (around £6) which is good value.
All in all, the food was so good that we returned for a second visit before leaving Danang.
