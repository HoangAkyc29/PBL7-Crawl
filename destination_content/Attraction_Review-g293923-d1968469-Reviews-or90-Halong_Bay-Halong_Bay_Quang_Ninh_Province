Một lần làm Tourguide tại Vịnh Hạ Long
thg 10 năm 2017 • Doanh nghiệp
Sững trước mặt nhấp nhô núi biếc
Đứng canh chừng ru giấc ngủ biển em
Chờ tới sáng lúc bình minh gọi biển
Biển - Núi giờ lại tâm sự đầy vơi.

Tung sóng trắng biển nhẹ hôn mặt núi
Núi vươn mình giơ tay đón biển em
Núi đứng ngắm biển lòng vui dạo rực
Và thầm mơ biển đẹp mãi thế này.
Yêu Hạ Long và cây cầu Bãi cháy
Đêm nhạc theo tiếng còi tàu và ánh điện lung linh
Bài thơ núi hồn thiêng dân tộc
VietNam tự hào vì có Vịnh Hạ Long .

Chúng tôi đặt tầu ngủ đêm trên vịnh, đi 2 ngày 1 đêm. Quả thực Vịnh Halong quá đẹp. Đứng trên sundeck ngắm khung cảnh đi qua mà có cảm giác mình đang lạc vào chốn tiên cảnh nào đó.
Hy vọng chính quyền có các biện pháp mạnh bảo vệ Vịnh Hạ Long cho đời con cháu.

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

HALONG BAY CRUISE HUNTERS tripadvisor agent made us happy
Nov 2023 • Friends
My friends and me booked 6 stars cruise from HALONG BAY CRUISE HUNTERS on tripadvisor and they did a really great one. We came to cruise dock by ourself and there was some friendly staffs who've been waiting out there to wait and welcome. All cabins were modern, balcony, i got a really sexy bathtub then. FOod and activities were excellent even the weather was pretty cold during our days but all were turned out great. I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this cruise agent. Make sure you contact to A LEGIT TRAVEL AGENT with great reviews on Tripadvisor since many fake ones

Le Theatre Cruises - a luxurious experience in Halong bay and Lan Ha bay

This cruise line operates in both Halong Bay and Lan Ha Bay, two of the most beautiful and scenic destinations in Vietnam. You can enjoy the stunning views of the limestone karsts, islands, and caves from the spacious and comfortable cabins, or from the sundeck, bar, or restaurant. The cruise also offers various activities such as kayaking, swimming, biking, cooking classes, and tai chi. A great option for couples, families, or groups who want to experience the beauty and culture of Vietnam in a luxurious and relaxing way.

My partners and I spent 3 days 2 nights on a cruise on Ha Long Bay. The nature was gorgeous with lots of limestone karsts rising up the water. I also had a chance to visit magnificent caves and join a cooking class on the boat. Going kayaking is a must if you don't swim.

Memorable and enchanting sunsets
We had the most amazing experience at Renea Cruise Halong! From the panoramic ocean views to the comfortable and stable cruising experience, I was in awe of the beauty of Halong Bay. But the highlight of my stay was the incredible sunsets! Every night, I watched as the sun slowly set over the bay, painting the sky with a mesmerizing array of colors. It was truly a memorable and enchanting sight!
