Plan Your Trip to Da Nang: Best of Da Nang Tourism
Amid majestic mountains and azure blue waters, a new Vietnam emerges
No other city represents Vietnam's boom better than Da Nang. It's become a gleaming, modern tourist magnet, complete with condos, theme parks, and brand-new resorts. But the city's earlier charm is still present, including laid-back, friendly locals and incredible street eats. After you’ve stuffed yourself with a bowl of Mi Quang and Banh Mi Ba Lan, walk it off by exploring the limestone caves and Buddhist grottos of the Marble Mountains. Make an escape to the surreal mountain resort of Ba Na Hills, where the majestic Golden Bridge welcomes you with open palms.
