Chúng tôi đã đi du thuyền rác một đêm trên Vịnh Hạ Long với Bhaya Classic và tất cả nhóm 10 người của chúng tôi thực sự rất thích cả chuyến đi. Phong cảnh tuyệt vời chèo thuyền ra vào trong những tảng đá lớn, chèo thuyền trong những vịnh mịn và khám phá hang động. Tất cả trong một vị trí tuyệt vời và chuyến đi

Các công ty du lịch cần có trách nhiệm dọn sạch rác nhìn thấy trôi nổi trong nước khi chúng tôi chèo thuyền kayak. Không tuyệt vời cho môi trường hoặc du lịch. Ngoài ra, một chuyến đi tuyệt vời.

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

For those who love sunrise and sunset…
Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Paradise cruise 3 day/2 night cruise
Apr 2011
Having stayed at budget accommodation for most of our trip we decided to splurge on our cruise. I reviewed a variety of cruises through Tripadvisor and decided on a Paradise cruise. I booked the cruise through our hotel via email from Australia and they got us a much better price than through the Paradise's own website. And we didn’t have to pay anything until we settled our hotel bill at the end of our stay.
We were collected promptly from our hotel for the 4 hour trip to Halong Bay (toilet/shopping stop included) Arrived at the Cafe/wharf , given a lanyard designating which boat we were on (they have 3 almost identical boats) and then boarded a short time later. Up to the Dining room, keys allocated and off to our cabins. Our cabin was on the bottom deck and didn’t have a balcony (room was bigger) quick look around then up to the Dining room for a buffet lunch.
After lunch a look from the top deck then settled into some comfy lounge chairs with a view where we met some other Aussies and had a few drinks. Stopped at a fishing village where we were all rowed around by the local women (great photos) then on to a pearl farm for a look see ( and chance to buy) then back for a chance to make some spring rolls on the top deck (and sample them of course)
Another drink then a 5 course dinner in the beautiful dining room. More drinks (happy hour 9pm to 11pm drinks half price) and then bed
Day 2 all the 1 night people went to the caves while the 2 night people transferred to another smaller boat and were joined by the other 2 night people from the other Paradise cruise boats.
We were all taken to Cat Ba National Park? And asked on the way if we preferred to ride a pushbike or on the back of a scooter to the local village. The transport we requested was waiting for us when we arrived and we took a leisurely ride to the village for a look around and then a trek through the bush, a cave then back to the village and boat. A 5 course Vietnamese lunch while cruising among the limestone islands then a stop for a kayak or swim and back to our original boat by 3pm. Same activities repeated while we rested, another 5 course dinner to follow.
Day 3 we visited a cave with hundreds of other people (great photo op at the top ) then packed our bags and enjoyed the cruise back to the wharf. Worth every penny!!!

Amazing!!

Ha Long Bay is amazing . You can discover Bai Tho mountain, experience to go fishing squid at night. Or go a bit further more to explore Yen Tu pagoda on top of the mountain which is located around 60 km far from Ha Long.Or If you interested in minority comunities , you can go to Binh Lieu district which is 100 km far from Ha Long to know more about local life here!! i definitely recommended to visit Ha Long when you come to Northern Vietnam!!

Ginger Junk Ha Long Bay
Beautiful boat with old world charm. A trip to Ha Long Bay on the Ha Long Ginger is like stepping back in time. The boat is beautifully decorated and well equipped, the lunch on board was as good as any 5* restaurant. The bay its self is like entering a alternate planet lost in time. The bay people are happy to welcome you into their world and proud to show off their homes & families. The evening dinner in the cave was spectacular with a unique setting and top quality food. The floating islands and deep green waters makes a trip to the bay unforgettable. I would highly recommend the Ginger Junk for quality & customer service.

What a waste of time!

We booked a 2 day 1 night tour with Fantasea Tours. We had been highly recommended it by our hotel and told we were100 percent guarenteed to have an amazing time.
On the morning of our departure we got told due to a potential storm that the tour was cancelled. We were told that we may be able to go the following day. But 10minutes later the Fantasea bus turned up and the tour guide 'nanny' said the tour was all good to go. So we got on the bus and headed for Halong bay.
According to our itinery we would arrive at the port to get on our boat at 12.30. It was 1.30 before we arrived. On our first day we were supposed to have 4 hours of sailing around Halong Bay with kayayking and a cave visit. We got a 30minute paddle in some pretty rubbish kayaks and visited the cave for 30mins before getting on board. We were told the storm was coming and we had to go to Cat Ba island now instead of staying on the boat. So we headed straight there. A total of 1.5hours on the boat. The boat was nice however and the food was great. The only saving grace from this trip. As part of the itiney after dinner the crew would provide entertainment including games etc... But we just got told there is a bar down the street if we wanted then the guides went to bed.
Up at 7am by strict orders so we could get on with the day. After breakfast we checked out and by 8am we were eager and ready to go. We sat on the street for an hour waiting for the bus to take us back to the boat. When we asked what was going on we just got told to wait. Then once we got to the boat at about 9.15 we sat there for nearly 2 hours on the boat not moving. It was a different smaller boat than yesterdays and suddenly there were 3 other groups with us. So there wasnt anywhere to sit upstairs to enjoy the views. Only inside the eating area which was warm and clammy because there was lack of air movement as we were still sat at the dock not moving.
I asked when we would leave and got told 10 mins everytime i asked. 2 hours later we started moving. I asked what was going on and when are we sailing around the islands. They told me 'you will see them on the way back to the mainland'. Then i started to get really annoyed. I said where am i supposed to sit? when are we doing the cooking class we were promised? When do we do our hiking? and when do we get to swim? In response i was told "we have too many tourists and have to go back to the mainland now" WHAT A JOKE!
It took an hour and 15 to get back to the mainland after spending a whole morning doing absolutly nothing but wait around. We then waited 45mins for the bus on the mainland to take us back to Hanoi.
It was a total waste of time. We paid $95US each which was more expensive than other companies and by far the most expensive tour weve paid for in south east asia... (And weve done alot)
Back at the hotel we complained and asked to speak to the company manager, which our hotel arranged by phone call. All they would do was blame 'the storm' which by the way was half an hour of light rain at 11pm. I can understand taking precaution, so i accept staying on Cat Ba island was a safety issue, and although disappointing, was acceptable. The total lack of organisation and abilty to provide 90percent of the itinery was inexcusable. After a 2 day arguement we managed to get $25US back each. Which was something but fell far short of what i believe was owed to us. We paid for a service they did not provide. We could have caught a bus to Halong and taken a boat for a day then come back to Hanoi for $30 and seen much more.
I see they have lots of good reviews on trip advisor. So its clear somedays they can provide what they offer but others they woefully fail.
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!

Halong Bay YES! APT Travel NO!
Mar 2015 • Friends
I would strongly recogmend not to travel threw halong bay with a cruise offered by apt travel. We were immensely disappointed about the level of service, state of the boat, the crew, the food, the guides and other staff on the boat.. just about everything.
First to say: the cabines were nice and had an outside window which was nice. Only problem was, that the toilet flush didnt work for some time, but that was still ok after our experiences with other toilets around vietnam and cambodia.
However not okay we found, that our 2 nights / 3 day trip which was meant to have a set program with different activities for each day - at least that was written on our programm description sheet - was not actually complied with. The first day was ok, only when the program of the second and the third day was exactly the same, meaning visiting the exact same pearlfarm twice, because the obviously mixed different tours on the same boat. Anyhow we didnt see as much of the bay as was promised to us in the brochures. The "local vine and fruit" tasting consisted of a tiny drop of not so delicious red wine ( maybe not their fault but still just one single wine for a wine tasting) and about 5 oranges sliced into quarters for 10 people as "local fruits".
Food was in total ok but the very same every day. If you are still hungry their was no way of getting anything but rice without anything, getting more fruit basecly impossible. Do not expect to get the hot food main dishes like fish or meat together with the rice - it arrives at the table just about 5 minutes after everything else is finished or icecold.
Meals were acompanied with hard bass electronic music which was plaid by the crew throughout the day. Whilst some may find this appropriate for the scenery, we found it nervewrakking and anoying. However the crew was not concerned about our opinion on changing or putting down the volume.
After complaining about our problems and speaking to our guide he basecally told us that all wasnt his falt and that he was only the guide and visiting the same pearl farm twice was perfectly ok and adequate and that we should talk to our travel agencie. And I guess you can imagine what that means in vietnam. The guide named himselfe "Franc" and got loud and very impolite to us, resulting in him not looking at or speaking with us anymore - eventhough we tried to settle everything in a very polite vietnamese way without getting angry.
We paid about 240 USD each for the trip which was way to much for the service we got.
Summing up: bad service - false brochures and program - activities on board cannot be compared to the brochures, its more like pulling it threw in order to be able to write more on the programm - impolite guide and staff - no individualism, just getting it over with the timetable.
Halong Bay is a beautiful place which one should be able to enjoy and that should not be spoilt by such a bad experience. travel with a different company and hopefully you will be able to enjoy more! GO THERE BUT NOT WITH APT!

Big Scam!!!! Be Careful
Apr 2013 • Friends
We just arrived back from a very disappointing trip to Halong Bay due to a scam.
We booked through a tour company that claimed to be "Sinh Cafe Travel" but in actual fact was one of the many fake Sinh Cafe's. We booked for an overnight cruise on a delux boat with Dujong Sails and paid $80 each.
The tour guide who arrived at the hotel in the morning was from a completely different company "Joy Travel" and was taking us on a completely different boat. When we asked what was going on our trusty tour guide stated "I'm just the tour guide" which seemed to be his catch-phrase for the trip. He told us we needed to get on the bus and he would contact the tour company and sort it out.
Over 2 hours into our journey to Halong Bay we stopped, and after nagging he finally contacted the tour company. We then realised that we were going on a budget boat that most people had paid $55 for - this is not where we planned on celebrating our friends birthday. We explained that we did not want to go on that boat as it was not the same standard that we paid for. We were given the choice of finding our own way back to Hanoi or getting back on the bus. Reluctantly we chose the bus.
Trying to stay positive we thought it might not be so bad. We were wrong. When we got on the boat it was very obvious that they overbooked. There were 30 people and only 8 rooms. We crammed in the cabin for lunch and then were on our way to the caves. We were told that another boat would arrive after the seeing the caves and half of us would go on that boat. Another lie.
After arriving back from the caves all 30 boarded the boat again. Still without rooms we cruised around the bay. We paid $5 for a "free kayak" and sat on the roof of our boat wondering where we we would sleep. Any time anyone asked a question our trusty guide would say "I don't know, I'm just the tour guide". Our boat came to a stop at Catba island where we were tied to the pier for 2 hours. We were not allowed to to get off the boat or swim here so just sat and waited.
Again we asked the tour guide what was going on and where the other boat was. It was very clear that he had no idea - he then asked me to inform everyone on board that he had no idea where everyone was sleeping or eating that night. I refused. Finally at 7pm, 6 hours after the check-in time, another boat arrived and we could all check into our rooms. We were then given the option of swimming, since it was very dark at this stage most people declined.
At 7.30 the next morning breakfast was served, we had to check out of our rooms by 8 and was then given the opportunity for swimming - for a whole 2 minutes!!! We then went back to Catba pier and waited again. Our tour guide abandoned our boat here and joint another tour group. We were then taken back to the mainland and were off the boat by 10.30 - three hours earlier than our printed schedule.
We were picked up by another tour guide on the wharf and were told we were going to restraunt for lunch. After standing on the side of the road for over an hour in the heat a minivan finally arrived to take us to the restraunt where we ate cold rice and fish. A bus came to pick us up after lunch, we all crammed in and then sat in front of the restraunt aimlessly for 20 minutes. We began the drive back to Hanoi only for the bus to turn around after 10 minutes to go back to the restraunt so that more people could cram into our bus.
Finally we arrived back in Hanoi and met with the tour company. After an hour long heated conversation, threatening to contact the police and the embassy we were able to get a $40 back from the trip.
Halong Bay was beautiful and in the past I have had an amazing time there, but be really careful who you book through. Do not trust the people at "Sinh Cafe" on 13 Cau Go or "Joy Travel" as they are con-artists and theives.

Halong Bay-worth every minute!
We have just returned from a fantastic 3 weeks in Vietnam. One of the many highlights was our visit to Halong Bay.We did an overnight tour staying on a boat.We had a good mixture of passengers (16)and many different nationalities which made it more interesting. We all enjoyed the beautiful weather (November)and the peaceful movement of the boat.The scenery is beautiful and it was so relaxing sitting on the top deck soaking up all the sun and later on the sunset.It did get a bit crowded with all the other tour boats,but they didn't take away the magic of the Bay. The food was good, the staff were helpful and the cabins were comfortable. A truly great place to visit!

A Huge Disappointment and an Ecological Disaster
Feb 2019 • Couples
We were at two minds about a an overnight cruise, as we had been given very mixed reviews by those we knew who had also taken a cruise.
Firstly the journey from Hanoi was 3.5 hours each way and a boring way to waste the best part of the day on the road through pretty dull scenery.
So the bay itself is a perfect example of how mass tourism has destroyed the very environment that people go to enjoy. There must have been literally hundreds of tourist boats, both overnight and day trips.
The water was terribly polluted with plastic of all varieties as well as other garbage and debris, including human waste!
The volume of boats mostly diesel driven produced another layer of pollution both in terms of exhaust fumes and noise from the engines and loud music played from some boats on passage and at anchor during the evening.
The many boats form a queue to visit the very few shore excursions - the oyster/pearl farm and a small Karst island which you can ascend by steps with scores of others.
Although our cruise ship was quite modern and comfortable we were very aware that we were part of a tourist sausage machine.
All in all in all honesty I really couldn't recommend this. As a UNESCO site it is something of a disgrace that this is not policed properly in terms of numbers of boats and visitors.
We had three wonderful weeks in Vietnam and this was definitely the only low point as well as being poor value for money.
I wish we had spent the two days visiting one of the many beautiful and unspoilt parts of Vietnam.

An incredible place but DO NOT go via Halong city or through an overpriced cruise/boat/tour from Hanoi. Go to the commercially undeveloped yet gorgeous Cat Ba island and get a bargain trip from there without the crowds, noise and pollution

Halong Happy Cruise and Dragon Pearl White Cruise - SCAM company
Aug 2013 • Couples
I would like to put a warning about these companies. We booked through booking.com (which have now removed them) and agoda also carries this company. We paid for the trip 276 dollars and the actual cost was around 60 dollars. We were lied to repetitively and the rooms advertised had none of the amenities. The boat was awful. We were effectively put on a hostel boat. We were not allowed to return back to Halong until the second day and we felt very distressed and anxious as we were not sure what would happen as no one would tell us the truth. I am requesting that agoda removes this company also. Please beware.
