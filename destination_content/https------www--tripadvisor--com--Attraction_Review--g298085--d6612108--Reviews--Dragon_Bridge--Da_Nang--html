About
This 2,185-foot-long bridge shaped like an undulating golden dragon is the most famous bridge over the Han River in downtown Danang. On weekend nights, the dragon comes to life in quite an unusual way: the bridge is closed to traffic, and the massive dragon head on the east end of the bridge releases bursts of flames and water in a spectacular night show. Prepare to get wet if you stand on the bridge near the head. Otherwise, you can view the spectacle from the river bank along Tran Hung Dao Street or many of the nearby rooftop bars. The bridge is usually a stop on a night tour of Da Nang. ‚Äì Tripadvisor

Awesome!
Really cool to see. Go half hour earlier and walk the bridge to the other side and see the views over the river. Da Nang is beautifully vibrant at night and lit up so well it‚Äôs stunning. There are places for coffee or drinks nearby however it gets so crazy busy. Everyone is happy and great but wildly over crowded. Not to let this deter you but just to be prepared. There‚Äôs a night market right nearby which people come from and then go to after the Dragon Bridge show. If you stand on the bridge or underneath on either side you can get soaked. Otherwise there is a huge standing area a bit further down the street that is a perfect viewing point without getting wet. Would recommend for the light show and if you have kids. The show lasts about 10 minutes in total. Started with fire then ends with water.

Fire Breathing üê≤ Bridge
A great fun experience as the busy Da Nang traffic is stopped at 9:00pm for the Dragon to do its thing. The dragon blew fire and water for about 10 minutes, very spectacular and pleasing the very large crowd. Well worth going to but recommend arriving at least 30 minutes to ensure you get a reasonable viewpoint.

Interesting fire and water show
It is worth a visit to admire the unique beauty at night and see the fire and water show which is at 9 o‚Äôclock on Saturday and Sunday nights. Remember to stay away from the dragon‚Äôs head or you may get wet during the water-breathing show. A minus point is that it takes much time to be back to your hotel after the show because of the trafic jam.

Unique !!
We drove through this iconic Dragon Bridge across Han River during the day . Although we did witness the intermitten changing colors from led lights on the dragon in the evening , its a pity we could not manage our time to watch this gorgeous Dragon breathing fire and water show at 9.15 pm on Sunday, as we had to leave for our dinner. Maybe next trip !!!

Lovely free spectacle to enjoy
Lovely spectacle of the city and it‚Äôs free. It operates at 9pm at the weekend and lasts about 20 minutes blowing both Fire and Water. It attracts huge crowds and the bridge is temporarily closed for the spectacle to take place. It‚Äôs a must see when visiting the city if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be there at the weekend.

Colorful Bridge in Da Nang with Dragon Sculpture
It was a long bridge spanning the river in Da Nang with a wave shaped Dragon constructed above the road way. At night there were multi color changing lights that illuminated the entire bridge. Sometimes the Dragon mouth would breath a sort of Fire!

Amazing dragon
Stayed at the Val Soleil Hotel in Da Nang which was within easy walking distance of the dragon bridge. We could also see the dragon bridge from the rooftop bar. The bridge changes colour at night, varying between reds, greens, golds - very attractive. We went to the bridge on a Saturday evening at 9pm when the bridge gets closed to vehicles and the dragon breathes fire and then water - great experience if you cam.

Fun and quick!
It was a fun show but it gets really crowded! I personally preferred to watch it from below the bridge on the side, rather than on the bridge due to the crowded place! If you stand on the bridge near the head of the dragon, be ready to get waves of heat and to get wet with the water!

Majestic Golden Bridge
A landmark in Danang. You can‚Äôt miss it as many places we visited are at both sides of this bridge. We actually went to a restaurant which is walking distance from this bridge to explore the promenade. It seems like an ideal place for people to spend their evening with family members along the Han river.

Short 10 minutes fire show
May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family
If you are interested to watch a short fire show and you don't mind the crowd, give it a go. The show happens on weedends, 9pm. The dragon head on one end of the bridge will blow fire, followed by smoke, then water. We went there on a Saturday, stood under the DHC Marina statue, crowded with people and smelled bad water. Nothing happened because we were unlucky, someone important to Vietnam passed away and so the show was cancelled to pay respect to him. We went back the next evening, the crowd got worse, every tourist was there to catch a glimpse of the fire dragon. We decided to just stand by the roadside to enjoy the show. Something unique I shall say, worth to watch or not, I leave to you to decide. I think it worth, not my fam though, they say no more such silly shows.

I SUPPOSE IF YOU'RE IN DA NANG, YOU HAVE TO GO AND SEE IT...
Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family
Having only been in Da Nang an hour or so, we decided to make our way and see the Saturday night show at the dragon bridge which, I believe, starts at 21.00.
We walked and found ourselves outside a riverside entertainment centre, which had sumptuous 'pints' of draught Tiger (@30,000 ƒë·ªìng) and a superb view of the 'Dragon Bridge'.
However, we felt a touch underwhelmed by the actual 5 to 10 minute display, the very beginning being the best part when the dragon snorts out the first burst of fire.
This said, it's worth going to see, as the night market is right next door, and there's some interesting grub to be eaten, even though the stuff in the market are a bit mundane.

A must see!
Dec 2019
Watching the sun go down and the lights come up is beautiful to say the least. Boats with lights floating up and down the river and 1 million ‚Äúwant a boat ride‚Äù hawkers getting their occasional victims sorry passengers.
You can light a candle and float it down the river, but the wind our night made one edge of the river colourful!
The shopping is great and definable worth walking around Old Town.
Was a romantic couple strip this time, but looking forward to returning again with my kids.

This Bridge "Dragons On"
With ample pedestrian footpaths either side of this iconic landmark, it gives access to the coast and city of Da Nang. Accommodating thousands of vehicles on a daily basis this bridges is never quiet, which gives it a character of its own.
This bridge in the evening provides opportunities to view Da Nang surrounded in neon lights. It also has great great eateries either side to dine in.

Happening Place....visit on weekends!!
Jan 2020
The bridge looks impressive and as the show starts everyone gets very excited but by the time you start enjoying the show ends abruptly. Its a really short show with nothing much but the night market near the bridge is really a must visit. Lots of Vietnamese street food, exquisite fruits,slushes,smoothies to try.Overall a good place to visit.

Very disappointing
Feb 2020
We stayed at the SenRiver Hotel which is situate at the 'tail end' of the Dragon. The Dragon only breathes fire twice on Saturday and Sunday nights at 9.00pm. We were happily chatting away when the first blaze took place. We hadn't realised that it was 9 o'clock ! By the time we had set our camera's the second breathe had already happened and we didn't get a single shot !!
A couple of rockets launched just before the event would have alerted us to the time and prepared us. Two 5 second blasts of flame hardly warrant all the hype. Don't bother making a special effort to see it. It's not worth it

Nice weekend event in Danang
Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Each weekend you can enjoy the Sin Tra Night market and some nice local music entertainment at the entrance of the Dragon bridge in Danang. We were there in December so it was probably busier than usual.

The Dragon is lightens up in various colors and around 9 pm there comes fire and water out of the dragon‚Äôs head. It not super spectacular, but great to experience.
It can be very busy so it‚Äôs good to arrive earlier to find a right stop to be able to take nice pictures and videos.

Da dragon fires first fire than water for 5 mins every Saturday and Sunday at 9 pm.
They will close the street for that event and a lot of people come to see this.
Be ready to fight your way to the front for a better sight.
The dragon Bridge is good reachable from the son tra night Market where you can go eat before the event

Just fun
Not many cities will dress up a bridge with such decoration to attract tourist. It's the effort Danang government put in to enhance the tourist industry and a credit to her. The design of this dragon looks impressive if you support the idea. There wasn't much to impress during daytime but after evening. It is worth the 2 hours to spend walking around the area to watch the so called performance if time allows. Before you move close to this bridge, you should walk around from distance to appreciate the full scale of the bridge.

A little bit of Fun on weekends
the dragon bridge has 10 minutes show on Saturdays and Sunday from 9pm.. it gets really crowded by locals and tourists.. if your in danang it wouldn't hurt to check it out.
you have some shows that take place by the riverside and also a huge market set up by the side of the bridge.. you got food custom key rings live portrait drawing and many more.. it's worth a walk.
