Reco Traveler Policies: Satisfaction Guarantee & Trip Changes
Reco’s Satisfaction Guarantee
Here at Reco, we stand by our service. If you are dissatisfied while planning with a Trip Designer you have hired, contact our team and we will work with your Trip Designer to resolve the situation. If your Trip Designer has yet to provide your itinerary and we cannot resolve the situation, we will issue a full refund for the $200 Reco planning fee you paid. If your Trip Designer has already provided an itinerary, we will evaluate refund requests on a case by case basis.

This satisfaction guarantee and refund policy does not apply to general trip cancellations.
Reco’s Trip Change Policy
If your trip destination changes, your Trip Designer may not be able to help with the new trip. If he or she cannot and you have not yet received an itinerary, you can request a refund for the $200 Reco planning fee. If they have already provided an itinerary, we unfortunately cannot process a refund and would be happy to help you identify a new Trip Designer for your travels.
