Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

For those who love sunrise and sunset…
Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

pollution in halong bay
Cruised on Halong Bay on Paloma for 1N 2D(overpriced and overated) during May 2010. The water was pretty clean until we went kyaking to a fishing village. It was dificult not to paddle through raw sewage and tissue papers. My wife copped a faceful when she lifted her paddle!! In the evening we fished for squid off the rear of the boat. This is when we saw a large amount of debris pass by the boat which included plastics,raw sewage and tissue paper. (and yes, squid was on the menu the next day!)Halong Bay is a beautiful place but the future does not look good for tourism unless the authorities clamp down on the polluters

Fabulous cruise......
We stayed on the Paloma Cruise 1 night, 2 days and had a wonderful time. The crew were so obliging, the food was enormous (7-8 courses), about 15pp on board which was nice. Unfortunately, we didn't get to do the night fishing. The room was nice, big enough for 2, good bathroom facilities. All in all, would recommend going on.

Pinta Cruiser with Columbus
Ha Long Bay is like the pyramids - a must see but possibly doesn't live up to your expectations. The air pollution was terrible making for a very 'foggy' couple of days - the sky did clear on the last day on the way home... The boat was quite comfortable for the 1 night, although we may as well have been camping the mattresses were so hard. The staff were lovely and the food abundant!! A bit of a problem if you don't like seafood...
Another let-down was the condition of the water in the bay - quite polluted with an thin oil slick across it the whole way.
No matter how careful we were with sanitising our hands at every moment, we both got terrible gastro... I have to question the food hygiene, especially when it came to the seafood and where they obtained their cooking water...
Overall, cool boat, awesome little paddle through some caves on the second day but I won't be rushing back. Would more expensive boats offer a different experience? I'm not sure. I'd only recommend this to a friend with them going in with eyes wide open.

There is no doubting the place"s natuarl beauty. However the water is often filthy and the place is overun with us - tourists.

We did a trip that involved 2 overnights and at the end of the first day we were thinking of heading off in the morning and cutting it short. At one point we counted 40 tourist boats excluding the high powered speed boats screaming round the part of bay we were in.
However the 2nd day was far nicer. We had the chance to swim as well as kayak around a fishing village and lovely lagoon. We would recommend staying for the 2 overnights. Thisd means you get to appreciate the place away from the crowds (we were there off season)>
if you are trying to sqeeze a day trip in from Hanoi you may be very disapointed. If the tours are not better managed and the waters cleaned up this place is going to tragically ruined. UNESCO need to get a grip of the Vietnamese authorities.

Could be a wonder of the world but grossly overtouristed and badly littered waters
Halong Bay's reputation sets it a hard task in meeting the expectations of visitors and we had looked forward to this trip for 4 months. We booked in advance with Sinh tourist cafe in Hoi An (the 3 day, 2 night option with a deluxe sticker slapped on it for $80) and found ourselves being dropped from Hanoi to the charming Marguerite boat. The staff there were friendly and courteous and the food, mostly local seafood, was excellent. The cabins were fantastic: clean with roomy ensuite, TV, dvd player, minibar, bowl of fruit. Our only bone to pick was at check out when they insisted we had drank three bottles of water from the minibar when we had drank one (there were only two to begin with instead of the usual four) and were a little bit stubborn about it.
The bay itself has reduced visibility in February because of the misty and overcast weather that descends on it. It is still obscenely beautiful. The big downer, though, is that the water in the bay is highly littered and in most parts unswimmable. This is partly due to the vast quantities of tourists being ferried about on it every day in hordes of boats.
The paradise cave docking area resembles a Hanoi traffic jam with boats hooting horns and banging into each other in the melee. The caves, while beautiful, have graffiti in parts and no effort is made to keep tourists from touching formations, which damages their development.
We spent a night on Cat Ba island, the village there being composed mostly of hotels. It is a good jump-off point for many of the more interesting tours in Halong Bay. It has one or two challenging treks which should not be attempted in rubber thongs, particularly if there has been rain creating a muddy slick on the ground.
Halong Bay, by rights, should be the type of attraction that only receives five stars from everyone. However it is rapidly being spoiled by unchecked development and overtouristing and it is a tide that will become difficult to reverse should it be allowed to continue over the next decade.

Kayaking in a Sewage Lagoon - Never Did That Before.
Halong Bay is a must-do if you are in Northern Vietnam. It is very beautiful. For the best experience, definitely do the 2 night junk cruise though. We did 1 night and with the 8-hour round-trip drive from Hanoi, it was just too stressful. Still worth it, but would have been much more worth it if we had another night. The landscape is spectacular, though if you've ever been to Guilin or Yangshuo in China, you'll recognize the Karst Mountain formations. Don't bother with a day trip - without the feeling of being out on the water, this is too much driving for too little payoff. Make sure to allow the time you need. This is not a place for a quick "I've been there" photo-op, you won't enjoy that - but you will enjoy being out on the bay for a couple nights aboard a junk. They all include shore excursions such as the caves, which are much better than we expected, and kayaking on the bay, which was nice except for the pollution (read below), and also an excursion to a beach or something like that for the third day.
The only downside besides the drive from Hanoi is how polluted the water is. It's downright disgusting to kayak through sewage and garbage, make sure you have your hepatitis shots up to date and shower thoroughly immediately afterward. The first day, we saw almost no garbage on the water and were pleasantly surprised. However, the next morning, we looked over the railing on our junk and saw the crew throwing garbage into the water, then discharging sewage into the water, leaving a nasty trail of filth as we left our secluded cove where we'd spent the night. I thought at first maybe it was just us doing this, but as we kayaked through the caves, and the water was brown and bubbly, with garbage floating everywhere, we were repulsed. The rest of the day as we cruised around, it was hard not to notice the piles of garbage and sewage spills floating in the bay, so I guess it wasn't just our junk polluting the bay. There is no current to speak of, so the filth doesn't disipate. Throughout the time we were in northern Vietnam, the government is conducting a campaign to have Halong Bay be one of the new 7 wonders of the natural world. It boggles my mind to think that they realize they have a natural wonder, yet continue to allow this unabashed polluting of their single biggest natural tourist attraction.
Despite the nastiness we experienced during the kayaking and cruise on the second day, and not being able to swim for fear of hepatitis, we did enjoy our cruise - just make sure you do your homework about the junk you choose, as they are not all made equal. A nice experience, they have just got to get serious about regulating the junks and their polluting.

Wonderful to see
Jul 2022
A super well organized and choreographed trip, and still very quiet in terms of tourist numbers. Halong Bay lived up to all expectations in seeing it... it is wonderful and beautiful and the weather was very kind. Kayaking and a cave visit were also included, along with lunch aboard the boat. A wonderful, essential day in Vietnam.

Ha Long Bay - Don't Miss It!
Mar 2020
My wife and I were fortunate to have seen Ha Long Bay in a way that not many people are able to. We were in Vietnam at the outbreak of COVID-19 restrictions and the Chinese border closed shortly prior to our visit to Ha Long Bay. Tourist trips to Ha Long Bay had virtually stopped by that point and we were on one of only two (possibly 3) tour boats that were still operating. At one point I appeared to be the only person swimming in the entire bay. There's probably little that I can add by way of description to that which others haven't already said so I'll limit myself to some tips
1. This is a truly remarkable place and you should definitely make every effort to see it
2. Don't feel that an overnight stay is essential. We booked a one day excursion from Hanoi and we had a wonderful time
3. Don't forget your swimwear. It's very easy to get changed on the tour boats
4. Unless you're physically unable make the effort to visit the cave. The steps aren't as challenging as they appear and there are stages where you can rest and catch your breath

Great in every way
I would rate Halong Bay as one of THE places to go to. The only slight downside was the weather which was overcast all day.
The islands you visit, the activities, the food were all excellent.
The area closed to tourism the day after our visit as a precaution against the virus so at the time of writing our boat was the last visit from any tourists anywhere. Let's hope it re-opens in the not so distant future.
