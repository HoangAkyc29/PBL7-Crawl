Ong Pagoda, conveniently located at Ninh Kieu Wharf, offers visitors a serene and immersive experience. While exploring this sacred site, take a leisurely stroll along the river to soak in the picturesque scenery, and don't miss the charming walking route leading to Can Tho Mini Beach, adorned with a small accumulation of sand brought in by the river (quite a fascinating sight, isn't it?).

Upon entering Ong Pagoda, prepare to be enveloped in an aromatic cloud of incense. The temple continuously burns numerous incense rings, releasing their fragrant smoke for hours on end. While this adds to the spiritual ambiance, it may prove overwhelming for some. To avoid discomfort, I recommend visiting either early in the morning or late in the afternoon, as the temperature inside tends to be more tolerable during these times.
It's worth noting that the temple has certain restrictions on photography, which can be a tad disappointing for avid shutterbugs. However, fear not! You can still appreciate the remarkable exterior gate and the adjacent area featuring the Ho Chi Minh monument. These architectural marvels showcase the rich heritage and cultural significance of the site, allowing you to capture some memorable moments while respecting the temple's guidelines.
Overall, a visit to Ong Pagoda offers a profound and introspective experience. The combination of its tranquil location, the ethereal scent of incense, and the captivating river views make it a must-visit destination for those seeking spiritual solace and a deeper understanding of the local culture.

Ong Pagoda is one of the ancient pagodas in Can Tho showing the unique culture of the Chinese people. With exquisite architectural lines, the patterns are bold with the unique Chinese culture. The beauty of the temple is still lasting over time, worthy of the title of a beautiful temple in the Southwest region, becoming a famous destination of Can Tho. When traveling Can Tho to Ong Pagoda, you can feel the sacred space and sincerely pray for peace and happiness for your loved ones.

The appearance of Ong pagoda stood out in the middle of the neighborhood. Especially the colorful architectural architecture attracted all eyes. The closed temple campus is built in the shape of a National letter surrounded by walls, in the middle is a large well yard. That welcomes natural light. The pagoda does not have a three-door gate like other. But only a single entrance, above it is hung a diaphragm and decorated with red lanterns. The two sides embellish the statue of unicorn.
The short slope of a straight temple pagoda does not have subtle curves like the traditional Vietnamese pagoda roof, the entire roof is covered with yin and yang tiles. There are many decorative animal shapes. Such as: Dragon flanking, carp fishing. dragons, birds…

Visited this temple at night while strolling on the Hai Ba Trung Street. It’s just across the Ho Chi Minh memorial. It is a nice small temple.

A beautiful very old temple, a place of worship to be respected. Take your shoes off, step over the threshold not on the board that runs across. In all religious temples and pagodas ask if you can take photos, these places werent built for tourists they are part of the culture and serve the needs of the population, we are priveleged to be allowed in them. Many beautiful pagodas in Vietnam all good places to go and contemplate your own life and to pray for others and the world in general. Go there with a good heart and a willingness to learn and you will come away better for the experience.

This is a small temple but beautiful. Lady Buddha of mercy is worshiped here as well as Chinese statue representing prosperity . Worth a stop off here - less than 10 mins before walking down to get the boat to the floating market.
