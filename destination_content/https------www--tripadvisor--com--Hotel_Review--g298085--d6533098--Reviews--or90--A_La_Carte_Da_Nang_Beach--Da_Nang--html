Overall good stay
Chose this as a family traveling. Front office wasn't that warm. Rooms were spacious. There were two play areas. The best was in the basement but had limited hours. The other one was on the second floor next to the breakfast area.

Beautiful scenery and spacious room
Spacious room with kitchen and balcony which overlooks the sea. You can relax over a cup of coffee or tea at the balcony or chill at the lounge at 23rd floor. Just cross the road and you can feast at the many seafood restaurants. The pictures are taken from my room, cool right ðŸ˜Š

Beautiful hotel on the beach
This hotel is truly beautiful! The rooms are large and have a fabulous view of the ocean. I loved the infinity pool - the rooftop bar is a great place to hangout. Although my one complaint is that they turned off my electricity in the room before check out because they had another reservation they had to get the room ready for.. It was extremely ridiculous and rude.

Xin chÃ o Tammykayly, Warmest greetings from A La Carte Danang Beach! It is great pleasure to learn that you had such a nice time at our hotel especially our infinity pool, rooftop bar. We believe that there must be misunderstand in the electric problem, because we could not turn off the electric without your permission to enter inside the room. Once again, thank you so much for taking time to share us with your feedback. It was an honor to be at your service and we look forward to having you with us soon again for your next return to Da Nang. Sincerely, The Ã€ La Carte management team.

Long term stay, wonderful experience
We stayed here most of the month of November and completely enjoyed it. No negatives whatever. Large comfortable room facing the ocean, great shower, kitchenette for simple meals. We loved watching an occasional storm come in from the ocean, watching the waves on the beach below is mesmerizing and never grows old. An excellent buffet breakfast and a restaurant serving both local and western foods cooked perfectly at prices equivalent to locals or better. They also have an in house baker making beautiful cakes and pastries every day served with the fabulous local coffee. We brought a bag of our own organic coffee but we havenâ€™t touched it, the local brews are far superior. The location is perfect as you are surrounded by many restaurants both simple and grand, all within aâ€¦

Cold showers
First night we checked in, the washroom wasnâ€™t cleaned properly. There was a foul smell and leftover gym clothes from the previous guest. They then switched us to another room without a balcony. The hot water in the shower only lasts for 5 minutes and itâ€™s a huge problem for 4 ladies staying in a 2 bedroom, 2 washroom suite. Apparently youâ€™re not supposed to use the showers at the same time which is very inconvenient. The shower has no door and the whole washroom gets wet when you take a shower which might have contributed to the smell. The staff are friendly but in rainy season not having hot water is a huge turn off. The pool looks nice but surprisingly they donâ€™t have a jacuzzi. If you like cold showers then itâ€™s an okay place to stay. Also, prices online are better than inâ€¦

My favorite hotel
My second stay.Love this hotel and has to come back. The check in process was quick and fluently by Duyen. We got a change to get upgraded to a bigger room. It's spacious and clean, includes two bedrooms and living room. Lot of sea foods restaurant in the neighborhood. From beginning till the end the service was impeccable for me and it honestly could not have been better. Much appreciated.
