About
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is one of the first museums built in Vietnam by the French. The main building was constructed in 1915. It evokes some motifs of French colonial architecture in the early twentieth century and resembles the image of the Champa temples - towers in Central Viet Nam. 

Visitors will have the opportunity to contemplate more than 400 artifacts on display, including National Treasures and others representing the masterpieces of Champa sculpture in ten centuries (from 5th to 15th). The artifacts were made in a variety of materials, such as sandstone, terracotta, and metal. Grounded in various themes from fertility symbols, deities, mythical animals and architectural decoration from the Hindu and Buddhist, they express the features of cultural and religious values of the Champa people over many generations. 
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is a must-see destination for visitors wishing to discover the culture and heritage of Central Viet Nam.

Could be a better viewing experience
A good museum, with written detail in Vietnamese and English. The only drawback is that there is no air-conditioning. Nor have they provided sufficient fans to create a comfortable viewing experience. There was no provision to even get a bottle of cold water.

Well worth a visit
We spent a couple of hours at the Museum of Cham Sculpture – the Chams are an ethnic minority in Vietnam with a long and interesting history in the region. There were some amazing sculptures on display, with a few dating back to the 3rd century. The audio guide was good. I recommend wandering for a couple of hours.

First day in Da Nang
An unexpected cultural experience, but the best part was having vietnamese school children practice their english on us "Hello, How are you?", "What is your name?". The connections with Hindu India surprised me as well as the size of the collection. Our taxi driver from the airport, adopted us and took us to museums, authentic restaurants and amusement parks. He spoke no english, but with cell phone translation we communicated just fine.

Great Education
The museum is really well set up. The sculptures are quite Amazing and the audio tour provides you with real insight. I could have spent longer there I was quite captivated by the history. It’s an open air museum and the mosquitoes are as bad as anywhere I experienced in Vietnam. Ensure you load up on the heavy duty mosquito repellant s that you don’t have to stress

Best Museum of Cham Art Anywhere
I have to confess that before coming to Vietnam I had never heard of the Cham people or the Champa Empire that lasted from the 2nd century AD until 1832 when its last remnants were absorbed by its Viet neighbours to the north. The Champa Empire was in almost constant conflict with its neighbours and had to fight off repeated invasions from the Viets to the north, the Khmers to the west and the Javanese to the south, not to mention the Mongols a couple of times. Eventually it all became too much and by the 14th century the empire was in irreversible decline and Champa became one of the greatest empires no one has ever heard of. Today there are less than 100,000 people in Vietnam who can still speak the language. The museum was designed and built by the French in 1915 to house a collection of Cham artifacts that had been collected by French archaeologists almost from the time they arrived in Vietnam. The collection of over 300 sandstone and terra cotta works is the largest in the world, housed in ten galleries, each one containing finds from a separate Cham site. The first thing you will notice is that almost all the sculptures depict various Hindu gods and demi-gods, even though Vietnam is thousands of miles rom India. There is also one gallery with Buddhist motifs. Even while Chinawas dominating the north of the country for over a thousand years, in the centre and south the influence was coming from India. I have included quite a few photos of the best pieces including the world's best example of a Gajasimha, a mythical beast that was half elephant and half lion. There's also a frieze showing polo players, just about the last thing I thought I would see in Vietnam. Located just off the Dragon bridge this museum is a must visit in Da Nang.

Fascinating
We took our time going through these exhibits. Good thing we finished before the school field trips and noisy tour groups came. Dear Management, please instruct the teachers NOT to blow their whistle to call the attention of the high school kids. After all, this is a Museum.

Visiting this museum is a must to contextualize your visits to the ruins of the former holy sites of the Cham people. Artifacts from many sites are represented here, not only from My Son.

Interesting Museum
Oct 2019 • Solo
In looking to kill some time whilst in Da Nang, I decided to visit the Museum of Cham Sculpture. Entry cost was 60K VND. As with similar museums, to get the most out of it it is probably worthwhile hiring a guide or at best, hiring the audio. There are 3 main areas to the musuem and some of the sculptures are truly amazing. Set aside approximatley 1 - 2 hours for your visit.
I had visited the My Son site last year and alot of the artefacts/sculptures within the museum are from this site. On a side note, I stronly recommend you visit My Son if you have the opportunity to do so.
Well worth the visit especially if you have some time on your hands whilst in Da Nang. For some reason, the portable airconditioners located throughout the museum were turned off when I visited. Whilst there were fans on, I still found that inside the museum it was quite hot so come prepared.

Interesting museum focussed mainly on Cham sculpture going back to around the 10th century. Worth a look if you have the time, an hour should do it. Entry is cheap.

Wonderful Experience
May 2019
This museum has the world’s largest collection of Cham artefacts., it displays more than 300 pieces including Shiva lingas garudas, apsaras Ganesha and images of Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu, all dating from the 5th to 15th centuries. There are also exhibits focusing on Cham culture today. The museum also displays terracotta and stone works of art .In addition to the Hindu-influenced pieces there are also some that have evidently drawn inspiration from Buddhism including altars and deities.
The Museum of Cham Sculpture Opening Hours: Daily from 07:00-17:00.A good place to visit in Danang. Entrance Fee -60000 VND.

Amazing history of danang vietnam
Mar 2019 • Solo
It was one of a number of stops during my day in danang. Collection of artifacts that gave you in sight into Vietnam culture. The museum was busy the time I went and our guide was competing with the other guides to make his voice heard. Free WiFi so could post my pics.
