Good
I have learnt that this place is very famous in Danang so I decided to go here with my friend. It is located in the end of a small street and you need to find carefully because there are many same place which have pancakes too.
I saw that it was quite busy in the evening at 7pm, so you need to wait a little bit to have available table.
The service was not really good but everything was very quickly, just 5 minutes to have pancakes with drinks, it seemed that they prepared a lot before they guests came in.
I like the sauce with pancakes here, compare with the other places, I see it's very tasty.
The price is about 200.000 - 300.000 for 2 people.
So recommend this place to you.

outstanding food, one of the best resturant in Danang, with very cheap price, will go back again
if you don't mind the decoration and not fine dining service, this restaurant is excellent. very very nice food for very very cheap price, menu is very simple only 5 dishes, and with photo. but food cooked with perfection. it is very popular among the local, it is located in the end of alley way, but it is the most busy one is the whole alley. definitely worth visit! must try restaurant in Danang. if you are big footy and looking for authentic local food, this is the place to go.

What a great Experience
I found this local restaurant on TripAdvisor and decided to give it a go. I took my 12 year old son and we both agree this was one of the best experiences. It is where the locals go to eat and is a very basic setting located right at the end of the laneway. You sit down and the food is placed on the table and only pay for what you eat. Cost $6 aud for our meal and drinks.

Great food, awful service
The service here is awful. Staff are rude and often barely acknowledge you. They're also slow and have no idea about basic hygiene. But the food is very good. Love the beef la lot with the banh xeo and the peanut dipping sauce.

What an amazing Experience
We found Ba Duong on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. We took a group of 6 family members one of whom is 6'7" and he can eat. The staff were amazing helping us build our rolls. The food was very authentic and terrific. It appears to be a local favorite and now it's also a Canadian favorite. Very highly recommended. And I fed my family with food and beer for $42 Canadian. It just doesn't get any better.

So Crispy, So Good
I love bánh xèo, especially the central VN version. Came to Da Nang and had my first meal of the trip at Ba Duong. Dreamed of going back for the rest of my vacation. Well worth the journey. FYI, you have to walk all the way to the end of the alley to find it.

A Local Vietnanese Food
Recommend by the tour guide, the shop is at the end of a small road. Food will be served once you are seated, you don't have to order at all! Food is quite yummy and special, worth a try.

Great Cheap Food
This restaurant was located down a little alley, so if you’re not careful you can miss it. A lot of other restaurants down this alley also sell Banh Xeo, so make sure you go to the end, and the restaurant has clear signage.
When you enter, and are seated, the staff will look at your party and will immediately bring out the Banh Xeo and Nem Lui for you.... because they assume you’re there for the Banh Xeo and Nem. Nem is charged by the number of sticks you eat, not all that’s brought out. The other items on the menu are optional and will only be brought out if ordered.
For my family (2 adults and young kids) we had:
Banh Xeo - VND 55k a plate
Bun thit nuong (vermicelli with grilled meat) - VND 25k a bowl
Nem Lui (grilled pork on skewer) 20 sticks at VND 5k per stick
Sua Bay (corn milk drink) at VND 12k per bottle.
Less than VND 200K for the whole meal, we were stuffed, and enjoyed all of it.... even the corn milk drink which was creamy and sweet.
Note, the wet towelettes on the table would most likely be charged if you open and use it. We didn’t use it so no idea how much it would cost.

Excellent food but cleanliness can be improved
The crispy Vietnamese crepes and flavorful dipping sauce is incomparable. We could not stop eating. The “nem lụi” or pork on the stick and beef were also excellent. We did not like that the pork sticks are put on the table, regardless of whether or not you want to eat all of them. The remaining sticks are later put on other people’s table, and the cycle repeats. Surely there is enough time to ask people how many sticks they want, and bring more out later if needed.

Okayish. Not that great than expected.
Banh xeo was too dried and hard to chew, it seems like they re-heated it before serving. Probably because they become too famous, they lost their passion of their foods.
And waiter was quite rude. He just asked how many people when I entered the restaurant and then serve food with no explanation and no asking customer's opinion at all.

Yummy pork skewers!!!
Loved how everything came together - the fried egg, pork, vegetables, green papaya, the rice roll and the sauce! Would recommend it to family and friends! This is the first Vietnamese dish that took my boyfriend and I by surprise!

Delicious meal for a decent price!
Went as a couple and spend around 117,000VND for a serving of banh xeo, 10 meat skewers and a can of Coke.
Food comes out with leafy greens, rice paper wraps and a peanut beef sauce. The idea is to wrap your mains within the rice paper wraps, and dip it into the sauce to consume as handmade rolls. The sauce really makes the meal delicious but some people might find the rice paper a little dry so make sure you don't double-wrap!
The place might be tricky to find, but most taxi drivers will know which alleyway to drop you off at. Make sure you walk all the way to the end of the alley as there are other banh xeo stores located there - presumably to take advantage of Ba Duong's popularity.
Ask for a menu if you're not Vietnamese so you'll get an overview of the dishes served and indicative prices. Can't comment on whether locals get a better deal, but it's pretty good value anyway.

Foods really yummy
Plenty of locals come here, including office crowd but there's as many tourists. Foods really yummy, they only serve about 5-6dishes. Just order all 😋 and if you have never tried, try their corn mike - it was interesting and actually quite tasty
