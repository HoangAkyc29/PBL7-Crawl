Popular destinations for Hotels with Balconies
Bangkok
Golden palaces, floating markets, majestic porcelain-laid spires‚Ä¶you've never seen a capital city quite like Bangkok. Visit Pratunam or Siam Square for premium shopping, then unwind in the European-style gardens of Dusit. Thon Buri is home to the awesome Wat Arun temple, and over in Phra Nakhon, you‚Äôll find the Wat Pho temple of the Reclining Buddha. Savor mango sticky rice at a food stall before taking in the gilded splendor of the Grand Palace.

Khao Lak
Just 80 kilometers north of Phuket, Khao Lak was essentially erased by the 2004 tsunami. But the town, and the tourist industry it relies on, has rebounded. It remains quieter than other coastal destinations, offering secluded beaches, tranquil nights and family-oriented activities. You want full moon parties and besotted nights? You‚Äôre out of luck. But if you‚Äôre looking for unparalleled scuba diving in the Similan Islands, you‚Äôve hit the jackpot.
Genting Highlands
Breathe deep in Genting Highlands where, unlike nearby Kuala Lumpur, the air is fresh and clean. Aside from its resort life, visitors flock to hill station to enjoy cooler temperatures, mountain scenery, strawberry farms, and a relatively undisturbed, natural rain forest.
Port Dickson
Feast on seafood and relax on the stunning beaches of Port Dickson, just 90 kilometers from Kuala Lumpur.
Amed
This East Bali beach town is known for excellent SCUBA diving and snorkeling. New hotels are springing up on this coast, especially in Candidasa, a scenic 40-minute drive to its south. Amed is also a great place to admire Bali‚Äôs colorful outrigger boats.
Muscat Governorate
The Omani city of Muscat is predominantly populated by Islamic Arabs, though it also has a sizable, non-resident Indian population, further rounded out by American, British and Dutch citizens. Muscat is a tolerant and progressive city, where English speakers are relatively common. Arrange fares beforehand if seeing the city by taxi. To explore further, consider renting a car. Don't miss the imposing Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, atmospheric Old Muttrah Souk, Al Alam Royal Palace or Al Jalali Fort.
Airlie Beach
The gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, Airlie Beach is the main hub for all Reef activities and access to the Whitsunday Islands. Stunning views by day give way to a vibrant nightlife. The Airlie Beach Lagoon is a popular spot to relax and unwind. Visit nearby Conway National Park and Cedar Creek Falls to discover quiet coves, beaches and tropical rainforest.
