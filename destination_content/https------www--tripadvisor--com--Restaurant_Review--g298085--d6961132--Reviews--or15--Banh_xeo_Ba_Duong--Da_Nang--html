Wow! Banh xeo
This is the best, definitely must try dipping sauce and wrapping is o m g. Wish they had this back @ home Southern California. Love the food. The place is next to three other places that has almost the same menu, Go back to the furthest one. One of the best meals I had in da nang.

Best Banh Xeo
I tried Banh Xèo at 3 restaurants before visiting (and a couple after) and I have to say that it's best here.
It's so crispy, the sauce is excellent, and plenty of ingredients to roll with that gets automatically refilled when empty. Staff are pretty good.
Don't go here for the ambience though.

Best Bánh Xèo in Da Nang!
Best Banh Xeo I’ve ever eaten! I got the Banh Xeo and grilled beef, which was the best pairing!
The Banh Xeo came with a delicious spicy peanut (and sesame) sauce and together with the generous rice paper, it was heavenly!
I will definitely come back for more!

vietnamese crepes
i had dinner here last year in September.it is a bit hard to get there,even i used grab ride service, the rider spent some time to get there.Bánh Xèo is a vietnamese crepe made from a basic blend of rice flour, turmeric, and coconut cream, along with other ingredients. The filling here included shrimps,bean sprouts,and you add herbs, cucumber slices, green papaya slices into the crepe,if ordered meat sticks,you can fill the meat into it(have to take the sticks out).finally you use rice paper to wrap the crepe,and dip into the sauce.the staff actually will instruct the way of eating for you. i ordered coconut and tea too,the tea is nice to eat with banh xeo,recommended.

Excellent Bahn Xeo in Da Nang
The shop is at the end of a small alley, make sure to double check the address. One of the best Bahn Xeo place, we love their Bun Thit Nuong and Nem Lui as well. A good mix of locals and tourists eating in the shop, delivery is available through Grab Food as well. Be patient as the staff can get very busy. Very affordable and great vietnamese food, highly recommended.

A place you should come on your trip
They had the traditional vietnamese fried cake which was very delicious with good price. Not only the tourists come here, also many local people come to enjoy. This restaurant located in a very small street may make you a bit hard to find it.

The best meal I had on my trip
This place was recommended to me by a local and I feel lucky about it. I don't think any tourist will find it by just deciding to follow this tiny street to its end. Place seems to be very popular for locals which is the best sign how good it is. I ordered their main two options, 10 of the grilled meat and a portion of the pancakes/omelettes, both were amazing! Nicely served, delicious in taste and more than enough in size.
Really the best real Vietnamese food I tried on my trip!

Oh yes, Vietnam food heaven
When we asked for a taxi to take us to this place we were met with doubt. ‘It is only locals eating there’; exactly and they know good food.
Paid €9 for coke, water and all we could eat. Lemongrass sticks with chicken and beef strips; lots of veggies and dip.
Do it miss miss this opportunity for superb food

DELICIOUS
This was recommend by our local as the best banh xeo and indeed it was. It was extremely busy, packed full of locals and tourists. The standard way of eating this is to roll the rice paper around the pancake and add other stuff such as vegetables, dry beef or some pickle. The pickle is very important I think. Peanut sauce is amazingly delicious. 10/10 deliciousness
