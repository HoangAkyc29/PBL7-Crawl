Hidden Gem in the City
Stayed right across from this place and took me two weeks to even notice and stop by. Delicious big bowl of fish noodle soup for just 35k. A big hit with the locals. Definitely worth checking out!

Solid inexpensive noodle place
Delicious and inexpensive place to eat the speciality fish cake noodle soup. Easy to order if you don't speak Vietnamese as you can just point at the sign in English for what you want

Good place for bun cha ca
Bun cha ca is a vermicelli noodle soup with fish cakes. This place was actually found on TripAdvisor and I insisted on trying it. That day was raining and we were riding on a rented moped. We found satisfaction when we finally got to enjoy our hot bowl of bun cha ca. It was good and cheap. I think it was about 40,000-50,000 dong for two people if I remember correctly. ($2-3 USD for TWO people)

Should try!
This restaurant is the most popular place in Danang for Bun Cha Ca (noodle with fishballs). Good food, good price. Should try if you are looking for a local food.

Local breakfast style for sure
I was attracted by the full of people eating there. Follow the local crowds and u could taste their favours. The fish balls noodles with crab eggs cost only $10 HK dollars. The taste is good and the eye catching point (free of charge) is the sweet and sour carrot and shallot and chills provided on the table.

Great local eats!
Our private tour guide Anthony recommended this place for a great bowl of local noodle soup : bun cha ca . We arrived for breakfast at around 8 and it was already packed! Our family of 6 got lucky enough to grab a table in the back and order 6 bowls of their noodle soup. I think that was one of the quietest meals we had the whole trip because we were too busy eating/stuffing our faces! :)
The bowls came piping hot; the broth was a flavorful foundation for the fresh vermicelli noodles and the fried fish cakes. We were given a plate of fresh vegetables to add to the dish. I really wish I could have another bowl right about now!

Show me better value for $2
For what this place is - it's awesome. Not pretentious - just good local noodles.
I had the Dac Biet - at 30,000 VND - great value lunch.
Yummy stock with tomatoes, pineapple and cabbage with the fish cakes. Yummy.
I didn't need to season with more fish sauce or prawn paste. Just chilli.
When here absolutely try the Sua Bap ( corn milk) - never tried it before - from a local producer and is off-the-hook!! And only 13,000 VND
Awesome value - will be back
You should go.

AMAZING. 300 year old establishment with incredible broth/soup/owner
I loved this place. We took our friends, and they also loved it. The owner is kind and sweet and seriously makes amazing food. It's only open for breakfast and is served until it runs out, so be careful to not go too late and miss out, as it's super popular with locals and usually packed (not to the point of having to wait for a table though).
