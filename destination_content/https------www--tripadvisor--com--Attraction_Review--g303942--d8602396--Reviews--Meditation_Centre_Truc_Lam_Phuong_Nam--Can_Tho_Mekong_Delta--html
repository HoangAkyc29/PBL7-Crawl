I come this zen monastery very frequently. This is one of the most beautiful pagoda in Mekong delta.

It’s interesting to wander around the courtyards and main hall of this expansive Buddhist temple even though the building is very new. It’s free to enter and we paid only 5k VMD to park the scooter in the supervised area under the shade. Whilst it is a religious place purportedly “Zen”, there was maintenance going on (spray painting window frames), the monks were setting up a stage and dozens of young people were posing and draping themselves in front of doorways and statues either for selfies or professional photo shoots all of which distracted from any sense of tranquility.

To visit Truc Lam Phuong Nam Can Tho Zen Monastery, take a look around from the outside to the inside, the first highlight of the temple is a very large area with many large items such as: the three-way gate, the main hall, the bell tower. , drum tower, post hall, ... all share a common shade of red-brown tile with large wooden pillars and the foundation is made of solid stone.
The high and wide gate is built in the way of a curved attic, roofed with red tiles. In the middle of the gate is a wooden sign engraved with gilded braille "Southern Truc Lam Zen Monastery"; Below the signboards on both sides of the gate are two statues of Vi Da Ho Phap (Mr. Thien) on the left and a statue of Tieu Dien Dai Si (Mr. Evil) on the right. In general, the three entrances to the monastery are very eye-catching at first glance when exuding a majestic, modern but very traditional image.
Through the entrance gate is a spacious bright red brick courtyard leading to the main hall, visitors will see 2 rows of marble statues of Arhats placed in parallel. At the foot of each statue are engraved the names of heroes who have defended and built the country.
Truc Lam Phuong Nam Buddhist Meditation Monastery is located in My Khanh Commune, Phong Dien District, Can Tho City. This is the largest monastery in the Southwest region. The monastery was started construction in 2013 (year of the Snake), on an area of 38,016 m². After many months of construction, the monastery was inaugurated in 2014 (year of the Horse). The main hall is a combination of Tran Dynasty and Ly Dynasty. The bell weighs 1.5 tons are made in the style of Keo pagoda bell tower in Thai Binh province. Notably, the wood in these categories is imported ironwood from South Africa. Inside the main hall, in the middle is a 3,5 ton bronze statue of Sakyamuni Buddha, carved in a sitting posture and a handle of a lotus flower (symbols for the pure and enlightenment); on the two sides are the Samantabhadra Bodhisattva statue (he is sitting on a white elephant with 6 ivories symbols for wisdom and compassion) and Manjushri Bodhisattva (he is sitting on a green lions symbols for the wisdom and holding a sword symbols for cutting off the painful thinking)
the temple are so beautiful with many buddha statues. I highly recommend for anyone want to discover about buddhism religions.
Well worth a visit, will take up no more than 30 minutes of your time. Easy to jiurney by taxi. A good insight into the past.
This one is nice and quiet local pagoda in my Khanh Mekong. You can visit and understand more Vietnamese buddhism.
Truc Lam Temple is the place for people who want to know about Zen. It is far away from the city so it is very silent. The visitors feel calm when they come to this place. Actually, visitors must not wear too short when they come to this place to show their respect. Do not make noise when you come to this Temple.
Again this was on our itinerary and it was very interesting. The temple is calming and brings you back to reality
I zipped over in a cyclo this morning. Its a beautiful temple, spacious with huge grounds. There's only 1 main hall but there seems to be many kutis and the grounds are filled with Buddha statues and bodhi trees and pagodas. It feels peaceful because of the vegetation and large grounds. I wish I understood Vietnamese, I would not mind attending a meditation retreat here. :)
This is one of the most beautiful pagoda in Vietnam. With a large Area, 2 lakes, specific structure and loads of statues. It makes you feel relaxed!
