Amazing
I used the club lounge and all the staff here were very friendly. I am especially grateful to Steven, Jadon, Lucas, who was very impressive. And I caught a cold during my stay here, and the staff took good care of me and called a doctor, so I was able to recover during my stay. I stayed here twice and it was so good that I came with my husband after getting married. It just happened to be my husband's birthday and he made unforgettable memories. All the staff were really nice, but the memorable staff was Maximus, and the male staff with silver glasses who worked in the club lounge during the day from the morning of February 8th. Thank you for your visit again next time.

Great food, vibe & staff
Tham & uten from barefoot are really friendly. They kept checking with us about the food, drink and feeling tonight. Both of them gave us a wonderful evening. The food in Barefoot is tasty and the vibe is chill & relaxing. Recommend to everyone.

A Perfect Evening at InterContinental Danang: A Special Thanks to Ms. Ly Pham
This marks my third visit to the Long Bar restaurant within a year, as I make it a point to dine here each time I stay at the InterContinental Danang. I've always been fond of its ambiance and food. However, this time, in addition to the aforementioned qualities, I particularly want to extend my gratitude to Ms. Ly Pham. She assisted us during our meal at Long Bar and showcased exceptional professionalism, including impeccable table manners, the sequence of serving tea and wine, and positioning. Her attentive and thoughtful service impressed both my family and me greatly, contributing to a truly perfect evening at Long Bar.

Amazing memory with this super luxury resort!
This was our first time visiting Da Nang with family and friends. The wonderful accommodation experience at Sunshine Peninsula InterContinental Hotel allowed us to enjoy the most top-notch, most considerate and most meticulous accommodation experience during this trip! Especially our dedicated housekeeper, Ms Nhi, who was very patient and considerate to us. She was able to respond quickly to our requests and resolve issues, and she was very responsive to things. The kids love her too! The hotel's environment, architecture, landscaping, and equipment are second to none. The unique natural environment and protected animals are all very fresh and surprising for children! Every hotel employee is well trained to make us feel at home!
