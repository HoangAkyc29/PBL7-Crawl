Plan Your Trip to Can Tho: Best of Can Tho Tourism
About Can Tho
Can Tho is the main city of the Mekong Delta, the "nine dragon river delta" where the Mekong River empties into the South China Sea. It's also the main transportation center for the region. The extensive canals make for a pleasant boat ride, and the nearby floating markets offer authentic goods and exotic local fruit. *Fly into Ho Chi Minh City International Airport where you can take a car or van (approximately 4 hours) to Can Tho.
