A nice sandy beach but...
My Khe Beach is a really nice beach with soft & white sand, temperate waves. There are several food and beverage options along the scenic walkway. Maybe because the beach is close the city centre with lots of hotels & residential nearby, it is too crowded...

Nice beach
The beach is kept clean and the water is crystal clear. There are also plenty of great restaurants nearby, making it easy to enjoy a delicious meal after a day of sun and sand. My Khe Beach is a great place to spend a day or two, and I highly recommend it.

Pretty beach on the DaNang shoreline.
Clean white sand beach with palm trees and mild waves. Picturesque panoramic view showing SonTra mountain awaits for shutterbugs. Beach usually crowded around 5pm after it cools down some.

Beach life at its best
Beautiful beach. We were staying in one of the hotels facing the beach and every moment was mesmerizing. Beautiful sunset with people hitting the water as early as 5.30, exercising, aerobics, zumba classes and more. In the evening with all the lights coming on and the food stalls, option to rent chairs and just making sand art in the clean sand - just wonderful. Life guards are always available and flags are raised to indicate when it's not safe for a swim.

The best city beach of Vietnam!
The best city beach of Vietnam! Really big and very clean (unlike other beaches). Here it is enough place for everyone, so no crowds. Luckily this part of beach os not popular among Vietnamese, so there are no people shouting karaoke, no smelly food and garbage. Comparing with other Da Nang beaches, this one is more developed with some bars and restaurants on the beach. It is really calm and peaceful atmosphere here. Highly recommend!

Beautiful and long beach
My Khe is the central beach of Da Nang city. It's a long and sandy beach, pretty wide. Many hotels line it, just across a busy street. There're many free parts, as well some where's a bar and where you can rent sunbeds. Water is shallow for long, usually with waves. Try to get up early one day before sunrise, as the beach is east oriented. Apart beautiful scenery of the rising sun, you'll enjoy many locals around swimming, practicing tai-chi, jogging, exercising.

Lovely quiet long stretch of sandy beach! May be we came off season. It was really nice and quiet. The wind cool. Great to just chill. Refreshments sold along the beach.

My Khe during Tet
Feb 2024 • Family
From our hotel rooftop pool and bar we can see My Khe. The view is stunning but with strong waves obviously not suitable for swimming. We decided to step onto the beach on this windy and wintery day. It was peaceful and rather empty because it was Tet. We didn't encounter any touts maybe it was Tet and the people were on Tet holiday reunion back home. There are a few massage huts still operating during Tet along the beach. There are "No Swimming" signs on the beach. The waves are indeed strong and at times look like mini tsunamis. I stood on dry beach to take a photo but when I looked into my phone camera and shot in a second my shoes and pants were already soaked by the waves, yikes! Obviously no swimming for anyone unless you are a pro surfer. While we were there during Tet week, it was too cloudy, windy and wintery to do any beach activities except for a stroll. Since the place wasn't busy for a while, we didn't see much rubbish like the rest of Vietnam. Having a short stroll at the beach was sufficient. You do not want to do anything else that could hurt you including massages that don't look very hygenic.

Even though the seas were too rough to swim - red flags out and authorities monitoring - My Khe beach is still glorious. For the moment, there's a lot of debris as Danang had recently suffered a number of storm hits. But, I still walked on the beach, jogged on the beach, and read my book on it. Plus, for history buffs, this is the famous "China Beach."

A clean beach within the city
Mar 2020 • Solo
My Khe Beach is one of those places where you could have fun with friends as well as spend some quality time with your near and dear ones. Stroll, walk, run, swim or just sit admiring the beauty of the gorgeous South China Sea, My Khe Beach fits all these descriptions. Just opposite to the other side of the street, is where you'll find the most awesome hotels and restaurants serving international cuisines. It'd not be an understatement to say that it's the most happening part of Danang!

Beautiful Beach
Feb 2020
Lovely long beach, soft sand, always a breeze. Worth going just to watch the surfers. Sun loungers very cheap sun loungers (40,000 VND for the day). Nobody hassles you trying to sell trips, plenty of drinks for sale available along the beach. Warmest sea water I've ever been in.

Nice but windy
Clean endless beach, but the waves can be dangerous. Make sure you get into the sea at appropriate places, with a lifeguard on duty.
What a shame they keep building huge hotels and condos along the seafront!

Chill and wavy
Feb 2020 • Couples
The view was awesome. The part of the beach that i stayed was clean with beautiful white sand. During this time, its abit chilly, so not suitable to tan under the sun. I dont get chance to swim here, but the wind and the view was just awesome.

Very clean and beautiful beach, perfect for long walk with an amazing city view on the other side.
Feb 2024 • Business
Clean beach with very soft sand. Designated areas to swim in with a lifeguard watching. Beautiful surroundings and lights at night. Also in February the water was a great temperature - tepid - not really hot or cold. I've been to many beaches all over the world and this is one of the best beaches I've been too.

Empty beach but has fishing nets
Nov 2022
Nice broad beach and gentle sea. Hardly any people because we were in front of what seemed to be a fishing area. Very few people swimming even way down where it was clear so you have it to yourself. A few plastic bags floating swirling around us takes off 1 star

We'd been told this was the best beach in Vietnam - hard to believe
Mar 2020
I haven't seen them all, and to be fair it's a long strip of soft sand. The waves crash to shore which could make swimming difficult for anyone less than very steady on their feet. Sunbeds and brellas are tired but cheap. My biggest gripe was that the sand is littered with cigarette butts and other small pieces of rubbish. Sunbeds are shorter than any I've experienced elsewhere. Maybe I missed the best part, but An Bang 20 minutes south was a better locations for me, with beach bars backing the beach which was cleaner and just as soft sand....

Great beach! Great soft sand! Great place to go run in the morning.

Wake up early, like 6am, and go to the beach. It was almost empty when I went, Incredibly relaxing. Beat the heat and the crowd. Great way to start the day.
