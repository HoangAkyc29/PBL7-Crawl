- the taste can be a bit too strong for some people
- the waiter talk very little english

Super good banh xeo
If some one visited Da Nang and never come to this place for banh xeo is a great miss. Not easy to find because it is deep inside the ally. Along the way, several 'copy cat'. So make sure you go to the original shop. The menu is very simple and price is listed. We ordered 3 items and all are very good. The meat stick very tasty. The slice beef is perfectly prepared and cooked. Oh, most importantly, the meat sauce, it is very very good. It goes very well with the rice paper. The meat sauce, and the vegetables are free flow. The paper towel is chargeable. 2 of us total bill 185k dong.

Nice sauce. A little eatery hidden in the alley
We went there upon seeing good reviews on this banh xeo eatery. When we sat down the lady just brought some plates of paper rolls with vegetables. Skewered meat and dipping sauces. We haven't even placed orders:). The menu is small and hence they probably could figure out what customers want to eat so they just brought the food. I ordered the grilled beef in addition. The staff showed us how to wrap up all the ingredients in the paper rolls. The sauce was awesome but I found it quite difficult to eat as all the ingredients keep fallling out and the sauce drips all over.

Fast and delicious
It was hard to find Ba Doung because it is located in an small alley.
I guess it is very famous for tourists and more than half of customers are koreans.
People don't need to order. They serve 'Banh xeo' and 'nem' autometically and fastly.
Also charge the money in proportion to the number of customer.
Worth a visit !!

Very oily
The banh xeo were very oily, as were the meat sticks you put inside. We also found it very difficult to get service as it was busy and servers didn't speak much English.

Tasty! Not for the mysophobic
Just don't look at the floor, the kitchen, the stainless steel tables and/or the recycling of food. Just eat, its sensational.
Love the fresh herbs and salad to combine with the pork sticks and pancake rice paper wraps. A cold beer over ice and everything tastes great.
Safer than Burger King at Chiang Mai airport.

Local Yum Bucket
Loved this place. The menu is limited because everyone goes for he one thing. I went with a friend who said the place was three times as big as the last time he went. It‚Äôs crowded with locals because it is that good.
Down at the end of a small alley, this place serves B√°nh x√®o, a savory fried pancake made of rice flour, with shrimp. You kind of pile them in rice paper with some lettuce and herbs, roll them up, dip them in a peanut sauce and enjoy. It is goooood. Messy but good.

Recycling food!
I was seriously craving banh xeo and was excited to try this famous place. It's very busy so I was expecting great things as we sat near where all the food was being prepared. Then I saw one of the staff clearing a table and putting the leftover veggies and rice paper to one side and serving it again to a new table! This is a great way to spread bacteria and totally unnecessary given how cheap rice paper and veggies are!

Eat like a local
Eating like a local, well worth making your way down this interesting narrow lane, loved the simple rice wrap and peanut sauce you can stuff with salad and the meat on a stick. Not as keen on the Pancake but still a must to try.

Very famous local restaurant
Very famous local restaurant. They only sell the same set of food. So you need to use rice paper to wrap different food together and dip into the yummy sauce. Very nice experience.
