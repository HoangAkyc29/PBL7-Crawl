Write a review
You can post a review on Tripadvisor in a few different ways:
From a listing page, scroll down to the Reviews section and click the Write a Review button.
From our homepage or your profile page, select Write Review. Use the format [Place name] [Location] for best results. If you cannot find the place you are looking for, click the pop-up window Add a listing to request a new listing and follow the instructions.
Although your review will immediately appear in your profile page, it may take a few business days to be processed. When your review is published, we will send you an email. If we cannot publish your review, we will notify you via email with the reason. 
In some cases, we will also send an email asking you to verify your review before we publish it, and you must click on the link in the verification email to complete this process.
Keep in mind that Vacation Rental reviews go through additional verification, and therefore take longer to be published.
