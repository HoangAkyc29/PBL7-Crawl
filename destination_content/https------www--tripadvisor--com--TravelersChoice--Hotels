Mahendra Singh and manish Sharma lifeguard. They were very friendly. They gave us detox tea and took some pictures of us with peacocks. We really enjoyed their hospitality. I would recommend coming to the pool if for nothing else, at least for the tea.

The Rambagh Palace certainly lived up to expectations. We particularly enjoyed arrival, which was special, and the guided tour around the grounds which talked about the history of the palace. We would like to especially thank Anjali, Amisha, Aidan Singh and Amar Singh for the hospitality they provided.
