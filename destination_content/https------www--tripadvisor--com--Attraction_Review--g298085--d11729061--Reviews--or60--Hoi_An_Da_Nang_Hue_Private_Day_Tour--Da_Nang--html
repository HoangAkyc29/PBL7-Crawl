Vu was an excellent guide that gave us the best personalized tour to Ba Na Hills. He was very kind, knowledgeable and caring. Everything went smooth with him.. ride, ticketing, sightseeing and so on. We enjoyed visiting the theme park and golden bridge. Also, we learned so much about history and culture of Da Nang. We strongly recommend this tour to anyone who is planning to visit the city.

Thank you Vu!
Best,
