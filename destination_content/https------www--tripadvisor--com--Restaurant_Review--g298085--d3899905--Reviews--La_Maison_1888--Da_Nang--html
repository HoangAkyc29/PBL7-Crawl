Overall good experience, but could pay more attention to details
Pros:
- nice ambience, beautiful hotel and setting; coming here for dinner felt like an experience in and of itself
- attentive service overall
- great variety of food and complex, surprising flavors that worked well together
Cons:
- the menu said they were serving a 2021 vintage, but when the sommelier served it it was a 2022. He didn’t tell us this was not on the menu until we asked, which felt a bit dishonest
- there was quite a bit of wait time between dishes, and we waited close to half an hour for the bill and were not told the reason till we asked again. the whole meal took four hours all in all and it was a bit too long for us
- some dishes were comically small; the eel and abalone dish looked more like leftovers. some dishes were too salty for me, but it might be a matter of personal taste; my husband thought the sauce on a few dishes were too overpowering, but I thought it was fine

Over-rated and over-priced French restaurant
Had dinner in this highly acclaimed French restaurant in Danang. The setting was beautiful as the restaurant was housed in a French-styled mansion on the slope of the very exclusive Intercontinental Danang hotel. The restaurant interior deco was nice and the service attentive but not intrusive. The ambiance was excellent and romantic. However, the food served, although nice, fell short of expectations of a restaurant of such reputation and pricing. If you have to pay about VND6 million (USD244) per head in Vietnam for a dinner, you'd better expect something very extraordinary. There wasn't any wow factor. For less than 5% of the pricing, you could actually eat an excellent Vietnamese meal in a local restaurant in Danang city!

Wonderful !
Me and my gal pal are celebrating the 20 th year of our friendship and wanted to have a very special meal and found out about La maisson thorough Google. The whole experience right from reaching the restaurant in a cable car down the hill overlooking the sea , until the last course is mind blowing ! We opted for 5 course vegetarian menu and by the end of fourth course(very delicious beetroot risotto) we just couldn’t move from our chairs. Then came the fifth and the final course - a whole array of desserts -and we thought we would not be able to get back to our hotel with so much food inside us but we had the lemon sorbet and voila! We felt a lot lighter . I mean is it molecular gastronomy? And as a special token they sent us a beautiful piece of cake for celebrating 20 years of our friendship! Thanks to the whole team at La maisson for a wonderful evening. Our special compliments to the chef . Cheers!

Indochine elegance at its pinnacle
Where do I even begin? the Intercontinental property is magical, like stepping into a different world. La Maison 1888 offers the finest French haute cuisine experience in the most stunning location. I've been back home a few days now and La Maison is one of the only things I can keep talking about to family and friend that ask me how my trip to Vietnam was. Cannot wait to come back.

Delicious
We have a prefect and memorable dinner experience there. Food was delicious and service was excellent, the staffs are friend and explain to you on every sign dishes.
The location is uphill and high privacy so I would suggest to hire a driver for your trip, I’m lucky to hire a trustable one - Quang (contact here: +84 90 593 24 32) and recommended if you’re visit Da Nang!!

High quality very enjoyable night
My wife and I visited the restaurant mid way through our stay at the wonderful Intercontinental. We were treated at the bar and had our aperitif on the terrace in front of the restaurant along with a beautiful cocktail. We then were escorted into the restaurant where our host sat us a lovely window setting. We were well escorted around the menu by Phu and also around the wine list by sommelier Jimmy. The entrée, main and desserts were excellent and a credit to all of the staff at the venue. We were also surprised by a lovely cake as my wife and I were recently celebrating our Anniversary. The venue is not cheap but if you want to appreciate some excellent fare I would recommend a visit.

Not Worth It, Eat Elsewhere
Absolutely not worth the money. The flavor combinations were bizarre, sometimes unpleasant, but the service was prompt and the presentation classic, extravagant French dinner. Telling that even the bread was cold, hard, unremarkable - the other restaurants at this resort were far superior.

Nice Birthday Dinner
My wife booked this place for my birthday dinner. This resort was terrific, wonderful service, nice experience. The problem is it is very pricey, and as always French fine dining did for me, very complicated taste that I cannot enjoy intuitively. Deserts were quite sweet but we could taste variety choices

French cuisine at its best
We went there for my wife’s birthday and because we love Pierre Gagnaire’s cuisine, we have been to many of his restaurants especially in Paris. This one doesn’t disappoint and is in the same straight line.
Reading previous reviews, I was surprised that my fellow reviewers complain about the price.
They probably don’t have a clue what a fine dining restaurant actually costs.
Yes it’s pricy but for good reasons : when you see the quality of the products and when you consider that you are in the middle of the jungle, you understand easily. And when you taste you understand even better.
Foie gras- exotic chutney- passion fruit caramel and toasted brioche, beetroot-passion sorbet on the side.
Well executed and finely presented. Bravo.
Lobster « Phuong-Linh » here you understand all the love of Pierre Gagnaire for Vietnam : he took a luxury product and treated it the same way that the Vietnamese street food. The result is outstanding. 3 plates Gagnaire style satellites telling you the story of this lobster worked from head to tail !
I call this wise creativity.
Kagoshima Beef Striploin A5+ : astonishment.
The fatness of the Japanese beef is combined with horseradish, sweetness of a stuffed onion, and very frenchy Pommes Paille. The sauce is made with mustard seeds and gives and extra punch.
Very interesting.
The Grand dessert doesn’t disappoint as well, there is maybe less than in Paris, where I was confronted to eat not less than 8 small desserts. We had 4 this time and it was enough !
My wife was happy to get her Birthday cake at the end, with the kind compliments of Florian, the manager.
Thanks to the very knowledgeable service team, our waiter this night was Toan, on point every time. Kind and attentive, proactive…. True class !
The wine side is well managed by a team of young and passionate sommeliers with an extensive wine list, abounding of hidden treasures, such as this Puligny-Montrachet « les Combettes » that Peter took out of his treasure cave.
We will definitely come back for another celebration!

Not worth the money
I have dined in different countries, but this place is overpriced. The Michelin chef let the resort operates under his name, so La Maison 1888 doesn't have any Michelin star, which most of the reviewers, including me, were false advertising.
The food we're ok but nothing exceptional that depicted the Michelin quality; the fish were dried, but they offered us complimentary drinks. I has yet not to visit France but this restaurant has marked me poor impression on French cuisine.

Over prices
We booked for a table of 8 for set menu dinner, foods presentation were good with good services, we had offer options of black and white truffles on top of main, the black truffles were tasteless and no fragrance, we were asked to to try a little bit of white truffles as well. We were under the impression this was part of black truffles extra charged.
At the end tne bill came out for more than $51 million Vietnam đồng. We feel like over prices for the money we spent and definitely were not worth it. Please stay away of this restaurant if you dont want to get over charged…
