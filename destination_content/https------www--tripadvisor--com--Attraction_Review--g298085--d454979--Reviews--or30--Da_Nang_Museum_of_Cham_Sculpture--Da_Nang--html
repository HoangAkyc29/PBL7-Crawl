About
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is one of the first museums built in Vietnam by the French. The main building was constructed in 1915. It evokes some motifs of French colonial architecture in the early twentieth century and resembles the image of the Champa temples - towers in Central Viet Nam. 

Visitors will have the opportunity to contemplate more than 400 artifacts on display, including National Treasures and others representing the masterpieces of Champa sculpture in ten centuries (from 5th to 15th). The artifacts were made in a variety of materials, such as sandstone, terracotta, and metal. Grounded in various themes from fertility symbols, deities, mythical animals and architectural decoration from the Hindu and Buddhist, they express the features of cultural and religious values of the Champa people over many generations. 
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is a must-see destination for visitors wishing to discover the culture and heritage of Central Viet Nam.

Could be a better viewing experience
A good museum, with written detail in Vietnamese and English. The only drawback is that there is no air-conditioning. Nor have they provided sufficient fans to create a comfortable viewing experience. There was no provision to even get a bottle of cold water.

Well worth a visit
We spent a couple of hours at the Museum of Cham Sculpture – the Chams are an ethnic minority in Vietnam with a long and interesting history in the region. There were some amazing sculptures on display, with a few dating back to the 3rd century. The audio guide was good. I recommend wandering for a couple of hours.

First day in Da Nang
An unexpected cultural experience, but the best part was having vietnamese school children practice their english on us "Hello, How are you?", "What is your name?". The connections with Hindu India surprised me as well as the size of the collection. Our taxi driver from the airport, adopted us and took us to museums, authentic restaurants and amusement parks. He spoke no english, but with cell phone translation we communicated just fine.

Great Education
The museum is really well set up. The sculptures are quite Amazing and the audio tour provides you with real insight. I could have spent longer there I was quite captivated by the history. It’s an open air museum and the mosquitoes are as bad as anywhere I experienced in Vietnam. Ensure you load up on the heavy duty mosquito repellant s that you don’t have to stress

Best Museum of Cham Art Anywhere
I have to confess that before coming to Vietnam I had never heard of the Cham people or the Champa Empire that lasted from the 2nd century AD until 1832 when its last remnants were absorbed by its Viet neighbours to the north. The Champa Empire was in almost constant conflict with its neighbours and had to fight off repeated invasions from the Viets to the north, the Khmers to the west and the Javanese to the south, not to mention the Mongols a couple of times. Eventually it all became too much and by the 14th century the empire was in irreversible decline and Champa became one of the greatest empires no one has ever heard of. Today there are less than 100,000 people in Vietnam who can still speak the language. The museum was designed and built by the French in 1915 to house a collection of Cham artifacts that had been collected by French archaeologists almost from the time they arrived in Vietnam. The collection of over 300 sandstone and terra cotta works is the largest in the world, housed in ten galleries, each one containing finds from a separate Cham site. The first thing you will notice is that almost all the sculptures depict various Hindu gods and demi-gods, even though Vietnam is thousands of miles rom India. There is also one gallery with Buddhist motifs. Even while Chinawas dominating the north of the country for over a thousand years, in the centre and south the influence was coming from India. I have included quite a few photos of the best pieces including the world's best example of a Gajasimha, a mythical beast that was half elephant and half lion. There's also a frieze showing polo players, just about the last thing I thought I would see in Vietnam. Located just off the Dragon bridge this museum is a must visit in Da Nang.

Fascinating
We took our time going through these exhibits. Good thing we finished before the school field trips and noisy tour groups came. Dear Management, please instruct the teachers NOT to blow their whistle to call the attention of the high school kids. After all, this is a Museum.

Buyer Beware
Aug 2015 • Solo
I visited the museum several years ago while on a tour of Vietnam. I was very impressed with the collection and its presentation. So much so that I did what I do not ordinarily do, purchase a replica in the gift shop. I was particularly interested in what was described to me as a sandstone sculpture of Shiva. It cost USD 600 at that time including shipping to the US. After a very long wait for it to arrive and process through customs I was able to place it in my garden. Within a few months and after several rainstorms I noticed the sandstone color was changing. To make a long story shorter, what was represented as sandstone turned out to be cement colored to look like sandstone. What a disappointment at such a cost! The museum totally misrepresented the item. Don't trust them.

Museum of Cham Sculpture
Dec 2015 • Friends
This was an interesting exhibit of Cham sculpture and culture. I was surprised that you were able to get up close to the artifacts to view them, with no barriers. It was informative and provided a nice backdrop for our later visit to My Son.

The Cham Museum is a good place to spend an hour or two. I have read criticisms and lack lustre reviews about the museum but really!! See the place as a public space in a low to middle income country and judge it by these standards.
The museum curates a wide range of ancient sculptures from the Champa culture. These primarily come from the My Son temple complex south west of the city (and west of Hoi An). There is a narrative around the walls about the items displayed and I learnt a good deal. When you combine the Danang facility with a visit to My Son and the visitor centre there you get a good view about this important part of the history of Vietnam. In the hotter months go early as it can get stuffy inside.

a must see
Apr 2015 • Couples
The collection of Cham artifacts here is huge, and interesting. Set in a a French colonial building, it really is a must see in Da Nang. Give yourself a couple of hours, there is a lot to take in. Occasional Cham dancing too if you like that kind of thing.
When you're done, go to the small pagoda next door, their are some amazing, unusual wooden deities, unpainted - just natural wood.

The Musium of Cham Culture.
Mar 2015 • Friends
One feels as if one is visiting a musium of sculptures in India. The Cham musium tells us the link that existed between these countries. When you enter, your site falls on a large Shivling. There are statues of Vishnu, Ganesha, Tara, various lion shapes and typical animal shapes one sees on chariots, temples in India. The sculptures are well preserved and the placards explain you details about them. The extended section has more such sculptures and first floor gives one much more information about the trade, culture, rituals, etc. This was our first overseas visit and we choose Vietnam and Combodia to see the Heritage of our oriental cultures which spread from Hindukush mountains in Afganistan to the far away Vietnam, Combodia.

A Great Collection of Cham Artifacts
Jun 2013 • Family
The Cham Museum (Bao Tang) is located in a busy street in Da Nang. I visited this museum on a couple of times as a side trip enroute to Hoi An from Hue City. There is a small entrance fee to get inside the museum. Most of the relics on display are archeological finds from the My Son Sanctuary. For a better understanding and appreciation of Cham culture a short trip to My Son Sanctuary is highly recommended.

May 2012 • Couples
Cham Museum, entrance fee 30,000 each. You can hire a guide to take you through it. We opted not to as every statue has a sign telling you where the piece came from and what it was about and a bit of history about which Cham region it came from.
Interesting, allow yourself at least 1 hour.

Cham Museum was wonderful
Jul 2011
If you are interested in Asian history, Asian art with beautiful old statues this is the place to visit. Most all the pieces are from the ancient Cham Kingdom. We went with my teen age daughter and 4 of her cousins. They all were very impressed and we all had a good time. Entry fees were Adults: 30.000 VND (about $1.50 American) - Students: 5.000 VND (about 25 cents American) - Children (sixteen years and below): free
