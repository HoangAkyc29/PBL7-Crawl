Different from Church, This temple for superstitious people who come to pray and worship goods for local God in temple with hopefully to be exchanged other good things from the God for their life. Instead of hard working, they pray day after day to wait for good things from this God. It's waste time

It't a nice place for people from CT city to carry out religion activities. I have spent 1 hour inside and feel so peaceful!

The temple is just located opposite the Ho Chi Minh statue along the riverside. The building looks gorgeous.

After visiting many Budist Temples, this was a little different. Huge burners hang from the ceiling, they looked like coiled citronella bee hives, these burn for about a week. Be careful walking under them as ash falls to the floor. Not so much as a Holy place as it is to pray for specific things by burning incense. Been there, done that.

Thursday morning 10th January and we visited this ChineseTemple, which is situated across the road from the imposing statue of Ho Chi Minh and riverside park.

From the moment we passed through the colourful entrance to this Temple our eyes were constantly attracted to the myriad of features within it.
At the rear of the Temple is the amazing Shrine with it's very ornate adornments and pillars. There were striking red coloured ribbons, hanging from the ceiling, with their Chinese writing on them.
There were a number of large conical shaped insence burners hanging from the ceiling. Inside the cones written messages were attached, our Guide explained that as the cones burn so do the messages and they travel up to the Gods.
Just inside the entrance there was a carved and painted door, this is the access door for the Gods into the Temple.
The entire experience was enhanced by smell of so many incense sticks burning.

A very beautiful Chinese temple. Look the decorations on both sides of the entrance. They constantly burn incense coils which is beautiful. Located in the center of town. Definitely worth a visit.

1st temple on TUI Mekong discovered tour. This is my 1st trip to Vietnam though I have seen many similar temples in other countries. Pleasant 20 minute stop just to get me into my environment.

Very unusual place to visit but interesting from a westerner point of view. Plenty of coil candles burning and people praying.

What an amazing place! We've visited many temples/pagodas, and have always found them to be places to be respected and honored. This one was unique with the incense cones - incense that wound from a large base to the top of a cone. They were lit and the smell of incense filled the small room. We walked quietly around and avoided disturbing those who were there to pay their respects or pray for/to the dead.
It's history was something to behold on one of the main streets of the city. The bike parking, if you're not familiar with Vietnam, is a treat to behold - something you'll never see in America. The spirit of cooperation in the country is inspiring, as was this temple.
