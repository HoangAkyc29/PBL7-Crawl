Dec 2023 • Couples
The trip from Hoi An to My Son was awesome. We were at 06:00 am at the entrance and the driver was careful driving at that time of the morning. He waited for us and brought back to Hoi An when we finished the visit. In total, slightly more than 4 hours. The driver was very helpful, kind and was ready at the meeting time (05:00 am).
We paid the trip after finishing it and that point was an aspect we liked about this agency, it is a proof f how sure they are of the good service they provide.
While booking it the day before of the trip, Ben gave us all the information required to decide the most suitable trip for our needs.
Definitely, a very good experience with this agency.

Vu was our guide today. The tour has been great despite the bad weather. Some 3D stuff is cool. A good day in a huuuuuge park!

My Son ruins…wonderful guide and worth the trip
Great half day experience near HoiAn. My Son is definitely worth the hour trip outside of HoiAn and our guide was terrific

Great tour, definitely recommend! Vu takes you to a couple of very nice restaurants. What set this tour apart from others for me was all the personal touches and information. Every place you go to has a special story which Vu will tell you about. You'll really go to hidden spots in Hoi An and learn why they're special. Also had some dishes I didn't have before, without them being very "adventurous".

Great food
Had some amazing food we never would have known to try otherwise - really nice to see a different side of the city to the main tourist streets. Vu was a lovely guide.

Outstanding. A Highlight!
Excellent tour. Bus was comfortable and cool. Our guide, Vu, was knowledgeable and guided us around avoiding the big groups and crowds. He was able to answer all our questions not just about My Son but the culture of some of the different Vietnamese and ethnic cultures. Highly recommend. You must have a guide to understand My Son.
