Halong Bay Cruise
We really loved this cruise and would definitely recommend it to all our friends and family! The staff were so kind and accomodating, they even upgraded our room for free and helped us with whatever we needed. Our room came with our own private balcony and a jacuzzi. The food on board was spectacular, with lunch and dinner having multiple courses. The boat and the room was very clean and well kept. It was super fun doing the activities and we took full advantage of them.

Highly recommended Tour Guide Mr Ben
I brought my dad (with knee cap problem) and a hearing impaired brother to Halong Bay. My tour guide Mr Ben was very caring, noted on my dad n bro special needs. He is professional and humourous. Mr Ben is friendly and helpful. He steered the tour with great knowledge and made the trip comfortable and memorable. We enjoyed ourselves during our full day Halong Bay day trip.

Amazing experience.
Our family really enjoyed the Halong Bay cruise experience. On the ship we enjoyed a large private balcony, open bar at happy hour, an amazing bicycle ride to a lovely Thai village where we enjoyed a fish massage. I won‚Äôt explain-it would ruin the fun. Just do it! The staff on board was great. Special thanks to John, Danielle, Mac, Ngoc and Xenia. ! We kayaked and went to the beach. The meals were amazing and the staff dealt well with our dood allergies and preferences.

The best day in Vietnam (despite the rain!)
So glad I did research and booked Jade Sails for a 1 day cruise to Ha Long Bay recently from Hanoi. Everything about this day was brilliant thanks to the incredible team (Vinny, Jenni etc).
It is a long day, but a good one. The pickup was on time and very much a luxury small bus with added touches (water, wifi etc). Tea is offered on arrival to the marina, with boarding shortly after. There was only 17 on our boat on this particular day with pretty heavy rain on and off. None the less, there was lots to see and learn. Vinny provided a great overview of the day, and answered questions throughout the day.
The lunch provided was good and thank you to the team for catering to my last minute request brilliantly. The cave tour and kayaking were fun, and the cooking demonstration capped off a great day. Due to the rain we were running early and skipped the full afternoon sunset party but I dont think that dampened the day in any way. Transport back was efficient.
I was a bit hesitant booking just a day trip for Ha Long Bay, thinking it would be hard to fit a good experience in (as opposed to overnight), but SO glad i got a wonderful experience thanks to Jade Sails cruise. Highly recommend!

Nice comfortable car
We had a nice comfortable car,. The driver took us on a quick no fuss route and got us to our destination right on time.
The driver had limited English but gave us a few pointers of places to go in Nigh Binh in the evening.
I will be using this company again to arrange our travels around Vietnam.
