Absolutely helpful staff!
We booked our cruise through Halong Hub online and our agent Tham has been absolutely helpful and responsive from booking to finding the shuttle bus to Ha Long Bay! Whenever we had any questions regarding the trip, Tham responded so fast and kindly helped us answer the questions. Highly recommend Halong Hub for anyone who’s looking for a Ha Long Bay tour!
