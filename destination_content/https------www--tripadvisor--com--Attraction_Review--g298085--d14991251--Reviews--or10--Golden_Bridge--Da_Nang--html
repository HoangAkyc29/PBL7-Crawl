About
This striking bridge is one of the most photographed spots in Da Nang, located within Ba Na Hills. This 500-foot-long golden bridge appears to be cradled by two gigantic hands amidst the clouds. Get there early in the morning to snap a shot on the bridge without the crowds. It connects the hilltop cable car station to the stunning Paradise Gardens, and you can enjoy breathtaking views of the East Sea and the Annamite Mountains as you cross. Check out the bridge on a guided tour of Ba Na Hills from Da Nang or Hoi An—it usually includes the cable car ride, the French Village, and Fantasy Park as well. – Tripadvisor

Enormous Cement Hands hold Pedestrian Bridge
The Golden Hands Bridge is probably one of the most iconic landmarks in Vietnam! The bridge is slightly curved and supported gracefully by a pair of separate enormous hands. Walking the bridge also provides some of the most scenic and panoramic views of Da Nang city and the valley below. It is an extremely popular tourist attraction and it's usually better to go there early in the morning or after 5 PM to avoid the crowds. There is no admittance fee to walk this bridge.

Fun time
The views very lovely. There were many things to do and you need the whole day to go there. But definitely recommended. It gets very crowded, so it’ll be good to get there early. I strongly recommend to buy the tickets directly there, not with any agency, you can pay with card. You can get there by car (I recommend to use grab) and they’ll leave you at the parking lot and from there you can take a bus (it is free) and it takes you directly to the main entrance. (No cars are allowed to go up, only the tours and the buses).

Don't come just for the bridge
Opened in 2018 this pedestrian bridge that links the cable car with the garden area has become famous for its original design where two hands support the bridge. It looks amazing in photos and has became a big tourist attraction. I was and still am in mixed minds about the attraction. I wanted to see it but knew it would be crowded and undecided whether it was worth the effort. I think it was worthwhile, not just for itself but for what it is part of. It is a pretty unique bridge and the hand sculptures are impressive. It only took us about 20 minutes to walk it and take photos. In addition the cable car, the gardens, pagodas and temples nearby are very pretty too and you get lovely views over the Ba Na Hills. Then you can explore the French town further up and visit the amusements and rides there. We took a tour with Venus Travel. Our guide's advice was to go see the Golden Bridge early in case of rain or fog and this was so right. By 3pm the fog had come in and it would have been obscured. I think we were also very lucky on our day. There was a lunar celebration in Vietnam and the whole park was less crowded than usual.

A mystical bridge set in the clouds, it’s a must see in Vietnam.
BaNa Hills is such a mystical place and the bridge was my favourite. It’s definitely worth booking a night at the Mercure at the top so you can skip the line and go straight up in the hotel cable car. You also get early morning access to the bridge before the crowds arrive by staying at the hotel.

The Golden Bridge in Da Nang is very Sexy
The Golden Bridge in Da Nang, a unique architectural marvel, creates a stunning blend of nature and human ingenuity. Stepping onto the bridge, I am captivated by the breathtaking views of the city and the vast blue sea. The sensation of walking on the sturdy bridge, supported by the giant golden hands of the Bà Nà statue, allows me to feel the connection between history and modernity. The shimmering lights create a mystical atmosphere, especially in the evening when the city glows beneath the warm golden hues. I cannot forget the feeling of the cool sea breeze gently caressing my face while standing in the middle of the bridge. This is not just an artistic masterpiece but also an incredible experience that brings me closer to the natural beauty and culture of Da Nang.

Worth to visit! Reserve a full day!
We went to see the Golden Bridge and realized that this is a big amusement park in fact. There is no point to go by tour - just take a taxi, buy tickets and you are free to explore the area by your own tempo. Its worth to take jackets and/or long sleeve shirt as its up to hill and we happend to be in the clouds - 10 degrees cooler than in Hoi An. Definitely very much worth to visit!

One of the surprise highlights of da nang
I wasn’t really expecting much after my wife booked tour of the hills but it ended out being a really fun day. The bridge was a bit covered with fog but we still managed to nab some great pics. Tips: patience is key. Time your photos for when u see a gap in visitors or groups The escalator down offers a quick picture perfect photo of bridge. One of the surprisingly best spots to see bridge is near the public toilets

Meh.
Absolutely no view at all. Was completely foggy and couldn't see anything. Kind of a bummer to drive all this way and take the long tram up to see nothing. Fun to climb around the top and grab a glass of wine.

The pictures don’t do the bridge justice! It’s absolutely stunning and totally unique, I’ve never seen anything like it before.
The views down the hills from the bridge are also stunning.

Lovely design
Nov 2019 • Friends
Loved it. It is a world-Fanous bridge. Now I have to admit I imagined it to be an abandoned bridge ontop of a mountain where you can meditate, if that is how you imagine it from the pictures you are up for a disappointment.

To get there, you need to go to Ba Na hills, buy a ticket for the cable car and get up to French village. There, transfer into a second cable car (Louvre station) that will take you right to the bridge.
The bridge is full of tourists walking around and taking picture, so accept this fact and appreciate its beauty lying in between the mist.
Cross it and visit the lovely botanical gardens.
Good luck!

Not worth the money you pay
Feb 2023 • Couples
The bridge itself isn’t actually that impressive, but I guess it does make for a good photo. The views when we went were completely covered by clouds so we couldn’t even appreciate that. We were getting bashed into by the sheer amount of tourists wanting to take 1000 photos of the bridge in different poses. I think we paid around $40 for a ticket entry, but this gets you into Sun World, which is a really terrible amusement park and tourist trap next to the bridge. Severely disappointing experience and I would recommend you save your money.

Golden Bridge Opening
Mar 2022 • Couples
We planned a trip on 13 March 2022 to find out after getting here the bridge is not going to open until 18 March because of COVID lock downs. Thats assuming it will open at that time. Kind of disappointed!

Mesmerizing experience
Dec 2019
The whole travel by cable car on the top of Bana hills to visit the Golden Bride was a dream like experience. The bridge was beautiful with amazing views. You would mostly find it bit crowded. Do carry your hat/ umbrella and sunglassed.

Must visit place.
Dec 2022 • Couples
Golden bridge is iconic bridge of Vietnam.it’s man made engineering marvel, must visit place.The bridge is designed in the way that it looks like ,it is supported by two hands . We went to bana hills in the month of December. The ropeway to the top is one of the longest in the world,5 km long. The weather was not good, it was totally covered by clouds and raining through out our visit.so we were wearing woollens and raincoat,carrying umbrella with us.the sun world is also good place to hangout and take different rides and shows.

Theme Park
Feb 2020 • Friends
The bridge itself and views would be spectacular on a good day, inevitably as it is so high the weather and visibility is often poor. The bridge is actually a lot shorter than it seems in photos and doesn’t take long to cross. Be aware that the bridge is actually part of a modern (well thought out) theme park - very Disney inspired. If you are travelling with a young family you may enjoy this. When we googled the bridge we didn’t pick this information up, if you are looking just to see the bridge and spectacular views then you maybe disappointed by the crowds bring shepherded Disney style.
