This was our first visit to Vietnam, Danang and Hoi An. Although the heat was sweltering, it was a wonderful experience!

Great tour!
Mr. Quang Linh was my guide and he made it really interesting. He told me many interesting things that now help me to understand the symbols in decorations, made many jokes, and helped me to try the best egg coffee in the city!
Thank you guys!
100% recommendation!!!

Wonderful VN experience
The guide, Vu, was very friendly and patient. He speaks pretty good English and attentive to our needs. We enjoyed Hoi An, golden bridge and SunWorld. Lovely sceneries and the meals provided were all satisfactorily delicious.

Beautiful Temple in Lovely Grounds
Beautiful Temple in well maintained grounds. Took about 2 hours to walk around a fairly flat route. Electric train takes you up to the site from the car park. Interesting history with our guid who spoke good English. Cafe at the end did very good food and mango milkshake.

Marble mountain tour.
Jul 2023 • Solo
Vu the tour guide is very knowledgeable and friendly. It was a great experience doing this tour. Learning about the history and culture of vietnam. A lot of steep steps when doing the marble mountain tour but it was good exercise.
