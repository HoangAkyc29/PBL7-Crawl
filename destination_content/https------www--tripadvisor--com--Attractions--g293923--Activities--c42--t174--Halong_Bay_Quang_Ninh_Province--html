A fun full on itinerary
Cozy Bay cruise is a great way to see Ha Long Bay. The boat itself has seen better days but our room on board was clean, the bed was comfy and the shower was hot. You could lay on the bed and have a wonderful view of the bay from the window. It’s a full on itinerary and you do feel a bit like you’re on the tourist conveyer belt when you visit the caves. But they’re worth it - very impressive and it’s a huge cave system. But what really makes this trip is the hospitality and hard work of the staff and the excellent and abundant food. You do have to pay for drinks and they served some fancy cocktails. It will also depend on the group you’re with - we had a young backpacker crowd on our boat and we were by far the oldest. They were a lively lot and this made it very entertaining - especially watching those that wanted to perform karaoke. You also get to go kayaking and you get a cookery class! Mr Lee was our host and he was always polite helpful and cheerful. In my opinion this trip is great value for money. The only sad part is the amount of rubbish on the water. We did see one small boat collecting it but they need to keep this beautiful water clean for visitors and wildlife to continue to enjoy.

Halong Bay cruise did not disappoint
We cruised with Athena Luxury Cruises booked through Viator. The cruise was well organised with friendly staff and wonderful day trips included. Plenty of food and well appointed rooms.
Our cruise manager Tim, was lovely to deal with and so helpful. We needed to change our bus plans to Ninh Binh at short notice and the Viator consultant, Ivy, was so helpful and had it sorted in no time. We enjoyed our time on Halong Bay, a beautiful part of the world.

Victor is the best! He is the reason we want to visit Vietnam again
Victor is abulutely amazing went far and beyond what he needed to do to make our experience memorable. He went out of his way to double check our hotels and day trips were all sorted out for each day. We have been around the world and never felt so safe and looked after. Victor thank you for everything!!!

Halong Bay Great Tour
We booked a private tour with a group of friends on our cruise stop in halong bay. Didn’t know what to expect but we are so happy we booked this tour. Robert was amazing from start to finish, very communicative and responsive. He was extremely patient because the number of participants kept changing and he worked with us to put together a program that would maximize the time we had in port.
He met us at the pier and got us a magnificent boat, boat was new and spotless. We sailed through the beauty of the bay and also had a stop at the caves. The Thien Cung cave was truly magical and so beautiful. We also had the chance to kayak if we wanted to and also had the bamboo boat experience.
This is a really really nice tour but was made that much more special by Robert’s professionalism and attentiveness. Thank you so much for making a stay here very memorable and special, we really had a great time !

Fantastic trip. Would definitely recommend it. It was cloudy but still spectacular and the cave is amazing. The highlight of my trip to Hanoi.
