A good place for BBQ meats
We ordered a variety of meats to grill and they were all well marinated and tastes well with their greens and spicy dipping sauce. The owner Binh is very friendly and helpful with the recommendations. A must try for visitors wanting to try grilled meats and beer.

Best BBQ in Da Nang!
We were very impressed by this place because the staff was super friendly and the food was more than amazing. We didn't know what to try, so the staff quickly recommended some nice food to eat so we trusted them. We tried the shrimp, the pork belly, beef and oisters (can't say enough words about the green spicy sauce) . What made the experience even greater was that we cooked the food ourselves on a tiny BBQ next to our tables. The restaurant is very nice, the staff speaks English well and welcomes people from all around the world. Please stop by this place, you won't regret it!

Excellent experience, would not change anything
Once we arrived via grab, the owner prepared our seating and gave us a quick orientation of the menu.
He recognized that we are Singaporeans and did not hesitate to recommend us the common popular dishes, which we went ahead for.
Interesting BBQ service, food did not take long to come (but we were early)
Food was tasty, well marinated, and the bill was a lot smaller than we estimated!
Easy experience, tourist friendly but local prices.
Would recommend!

One of the best BBQs in Da Nang
Locals fill this barbeque restaurant where you can grill at your table. Everything I tried was delicious including the Beef Sate, BBQ shrimps and fried vegetables. They have all kinds of additional meats and seafood available. Highly recommended!!!

Good & Tasty Local BBQ
We came here for dinner and was not disappointed. Most of the BBQ items are very good like lemon chicken wings, pork, squid. The only thing is you will have to do the BBQ yourself. Tried the clams & vegetables but not fantastic. Pls note that the portion is small. They have English with pictures menu so it is easy to order. Highly recommend!

Must Try!
My travel partner and I needed to find lunch while we spent the afternoon in Da Nang. Quan Com Hue Ngon lived up to its reviews!. Binh gave us a great suggestion on dishes to order. We even got to cook the meal ourselves on the portable grill for the table.

Interesting Dining Experience
What can I say? This place serves really good barbecued delicacies. Sure, it's hot, it's smoky, it's sweaty but it's well worth it. Come prepared to sweat and go home for a shower after. Their dishes are well-marinated with rich flavours and the mini charcoal barbecue grills are easy to handle. One of their specialties is cooked using hot stones in a pot. Make sure you order that. I would definitely go there again if I'm ever in Da Nang.

Fun night out!
I would recommend coming here if you're looking for a delicious meal and a fun activity combined into one.
We really enjoyed barbecuing our own food, it creates a nice social atmosphere.
The best was definitely the chili pork and the lemon chicken wings, we loved it so much we ordered more of each.
The vegetable side dishes are a nice addition to round of the meal.

Good food and service
It's a recommended place and one of the top ten places to eat in Danang according to the internet so we went there to eat.
In addition to BBQ raw items their menu also lists cooked dishes like porridge, steamed squids, etc. We ordered fish with banana in spicy sauce and it came with white noodles. Nice and spicy. The BBQ items were well marinated, some with lemongrass and they cook quickly on the grill. Nice sauces to dip them in. Free mustard greens to wrap your food too.
They have the usual height tables and chairs as well as the low tables with stools. We took the latter. It was a different experience grilling and eating closer to the ground.
Service is prompt and they even change the grill midway so we had a clean grill to continue cooking.
Be aware that your clothes will smell of the BBQ aroma after the dinner.
I would recommend this place too.

Good self-cook BBQ in a local atmosphere
When you want a nice cold beer and grilled meat, this is the place to go. The setting is casual, noisy and chaotic, and if you sit inside it can get quite smoky. Waiters run around delivering buckets of hot coals and raw meat to tables in an expert fashion. When it's crowded service can be a bit slow, but sit back an enjoy a cold Larue beer and some complimentary quail eggs. Lots of different seasoned meats and seafood to choose from, and you cook at the table-top grill. Great value for the money.
