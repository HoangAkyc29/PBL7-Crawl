Howard‚Äôs visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips‚Ä¶ ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠‚Ä¶

Other wordly
Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Fantastic
this place is awesome but take a private tour so you can get away from everybody else. By exploring on your own you can see the real beauty og the islands and the water in stead of visiting pearl factories and other non nature related things.

Amazing experience
Nov 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends
I went as part of a small group tour and the experience was amazing. Once we were there I saw the bay up close in a bamboo boat, you also have the option to do this in a kayak.
We also visited the caves there and you get to go inside and this was good as well. There are quite a few steps at the caves but I don't think they are too strenuous so older people shouldn't have a major issue
This is a great day out.

Great cruise holiday booked via Brilliant Halong Cruises
Nov 2015 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Brilliant Halong Cruises agency helped to book a great cruise for me and my wife. We had a great time on cruise( Aclass Stellar cruise) . Our cabin was new and modern and got a great balcony. The kayak and other activities were included in the trip and we only paid for extra drinks. Worth the trip!

Secret coves, interesting fellow guests
Oct 2015 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Everything was great about the cruise apart from the weather. We had 3 days of almost no sun, but at least we didn‚Äôt have any rain and we missed the nearby typhoon ‚Äì and so our photos are not so great. But it‚Äôs still a very beautiful area. The staff were very helpful and organised, and the drivers from and back to Hanoi were steady and safe, which is quite an achievement considering the crazy traffic. The company had been very good in keeping in touch beforehand, and they phoned our hotel the night before to check that we had arrived and knew about pick-up arrangements. The bed was very comfortable and the meals great. We didn‚Äôt enjoy the ‚ÄòEuropean evening meal‚Äô as much (because it was too ‚Äònormal‚Äô for us, though no doubt special for the Taiwanese group who had joined us), but we enjoyed the Vietnamese cooking and spring roll cooking lesson. The main highlight of the trip was kayaking through sea caves into secret coves, which were totally tranquil. The other highlight was chatting to interesting, well-travelled fellow passengers. There were only about a dozen of us on our 2-night cruise, so we got to know each other quite well by the end. How to attract friendly, interesting guests on your cruises and avoid demanding, complaining folk? I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Perhaps emphasise the ‚Äòadventure‚Äô part more than the luxury‚Ä¶? The wifi was intermittent, but this meant that sometimes we had to socialise instead of being glued to our iPhones, tablets and laptops.

Well worth it, but do 2-nite tour
Oct 2015
Amazing plce, even if we didn't have perfect weather. Absolutely pay the extra in time and money for the 3-day tour. Day one you don't leave harbour until 1 pm, then cruise 1+ hour to the amazing cave. Nice if you like caves but you have paid for it in the tour already. Then back to boat and off to titop. 437 steps to view point (more than 40-story bldg) so be prepared as it is stepp and steps narrow in places. Or, just hang on the beach and wait for others to come down from view and join you in the water. Water very warm and nice. Dinner, maybe karaoke (they love it here). Kayak next morning, then back to harbour if one night trip. 2-night is more relaxed with kayak and beach next day and time to just read, lay on deck. Food on my trip was wonderful, seafood, many veggies and a little meat. Great presentation. 3-rd day is kayak in morning, then head back to harbour. Book at least 3 star boat, mine was 4-star (orienal seas)

Select your Guide company with care

DO NOT give your passport to anyone, you can give them a photocopy, but when you hand over the passport you can be held at ransom, we were unless we paid to get them back. IF we had of had the passports, we would quite easily of jumped off the junk boat, left our belonging behind and bought new once back on land. The only endearing thing about Halong Bay is the view, but that is short lived when having to deal with the lack of service, dirty and violence. I normally love everywhere BUT seriously something is wrong with these people.

Fabulous. A must see destination.
Nov 2014 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Highly recommended.

This is one of those "must see" destinations in Vietnam. It's about a 3 hour drive from Hanoi, not because of the distance, but because of the speed zones and the hidden traffic cameras that most Vietnamese drivers know about.
Most visitors travel to Halong Bay by signing up for a cruise tour line either online (before arrival) or via contact with a tour agency or travel representatives at a hotel. You get what you pay for: a 5-star cruise line costs a lot more, but offers better, bigger rooms, less crowded tour boats, and more expansive routes throughout Halong Bay. I don't recommend anything less than a 4-star cruise line. My wife and I saw the 3-star line cruisers and are glad we didn't take them.
Halong Bay adventures via these cruise boat lines include kayaking, hiking, swimming, fishing, cave exploration, visits to national parks, floating villages and more. Go before the Government relocates all floating village residents to the mainland!
The pictures tell some of this story ... below.

Nature's beauty
Sep 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends
The place is worth visiting. Many companies offer daily, overnight or 3 days tours with possibility to sleep on a boat or island. My friends and I chose a 2 day one night tour with the boat stay. The place is amazing but the company that organized the tour was not good at all. It is called Golden river and this is why it is bad: the food was not enough and if you ask extra, max you get is plain rice. If you want a snack you cannot get it, my friend begged for a toast and she never got it. My other friend wanted some leftover tea from the breakfast and the staff tried to charge her for this. I had the worst experience there. The entire night was impossible to sleep because the rats were running all over the roof and when i finally slept i woke up to discover my whole body is covered in bed bug bites and one of the bites was on my eyelid and i have allergic reactions to insect bites and i looked horrible. i couldn't open my eye and the staff didn't even have a first aid kid on board. In conclusion, Hanlong bay - YES! but carefully chose the boat. We paid 80 dollars but they start from 120 and negotiate it to 80, which is the real price. But ask all these questions about food and safety and hygiene.
