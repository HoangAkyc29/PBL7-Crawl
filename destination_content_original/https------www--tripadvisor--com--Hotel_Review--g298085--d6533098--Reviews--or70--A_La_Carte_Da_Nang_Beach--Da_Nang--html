Beach facing Luxurious comfort
Beautiful location overlooking the beach and very big rooms with a great view of the sea . There are a lot of restaurants at a walking distance from the hotel.There is a convenience store just next door .The Staff is helpful although not everyone understands English.The buffet spread is very good and has a good choice for vegetarians also There was one problem although the hotel was not responsible for it At 5 30-6 am on both days of our stay there was a program on the beach and the loud speaker made it difficult to sleep Other than that it was a delightful experience

Great Location and Decor, Fantastic View of Ocean and Beach from Balcony
The hotel is located at the rightest location in Da Nang City, Plenty of street food stalls just at stone throw distance, Rooms with Ocean View Balcony are amazing, Breakfast is good and enough to choose from, Room Interior are unique specially the batroom shower enclosure in between the middle of room. BE CAREFUL OF BATH MIXTURE, Its get very hot and could burn your skin. Look for HOT sticker placed near the water regulator. Look at pictures attached to have a view of Room, balcony, Beach, The room entrance is through a huge living room with a tiny powder room and another Balcony with a cloth drying hanger trolley. Only one star less in my review because of damp smell inside room. everything else is unique.

Nice hotel next to the beach. Top infinity pool is tiny, but offers great possibilities to nice IG shots.
The location next to the beach is nice. Currently the next hotel is just constructing, and it causes a lot of noise which totally blocks balcony usage - and blocks all the view. And believe me, many hotels are a lot closer to each other than this approximately 20m distance. The road between the hotel and beach is just crazy. There are 4 lines to both directions. But don't rely on those directions, watch both ways before crossing! People are driving like lunatics in there. In our room there were two bedrooms, living room, kitchen and two bathrooms. Nice. Some fruits on the table when checked in. One 0.5l bottle of water every day as well as instant coffee and tea. In kitchen there were no forks, knives or pans and pots. I don't know who needs those on holidays, but kitchen‚Ä¶

Hotel on the Beachfront
Located right across the street from the beach, the location is solid and the hotel itself is a very good option to consider. Reserved a two bedroom, two bath room and it was worth it. There's an outdoor entertainment venue right across the street that's used almost nightly, so music/terrible karaoke/loud voices on mics will often go until about 2200 or so, then it normally quiets down. Just be aware of that. Room was spacious, breakfast spread in the restaurant was good (there's a kids playroom inside the restaurant), the lobby cafe was good too. Rooftop restaurant, bar, and pool was very nice. Great views of the area. There's also a spa on the floor just below the rooftop bar. Not far from the airport, plenty of restaurants nearby, free shuttles to Hoi An and surrounding‚Ä¶

Superb!
We stayed here for 5 nights which included the lunar new year 2020. We were in a 2 bedroom appt and it was such a fantastic experience. We had two balconies that overlooked sea. Every morning we used to wake up with the sunrise and look at the beautiful sea. Breakfast is worth having. They serve international as well as vietnamese foods. We loved trying new things there with a variety of fruits. The infinity pool at roof top was fantastic. In evenings it used to get windy and chilly because of 23rd floor but morning and afternoons were fabulous. They serve pizza, burgers, cocktails near pool. And oh their coconut coffee is a must try ‚ù§ We tried their pho and fried rice as dinner with sauteed vegetables. It was good. I wish they had more options in dinner though. The spa at‚Ä¶
