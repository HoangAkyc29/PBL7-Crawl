Interesting if you're already in the area
An interesting place to find out about the area and it's industrial, artistic and cultural heritage. It's a good way to enjoy an air conditioned couple of hours if you have time to spare.

Had a Good vietnamese massage. Room is very nice and well furnished. A bit more pricey but if you want good and clean classy environment , this is recommended.

Professional service
I went to the spa with two of my friends and we all were very satisfied with the service provided by the staff there. We got a warm welcome by the receptionist at the reception and we were given information about what kinds of service at the spa and we decided to choose Vietnamese massage with which we were very satisfied: the room where they did spa was small but cosy. The staff were well trained so we felt relaxed and pleased.

Great chef and authentic experience
We really had a great time doing to cooking class with Thuy. The place is very beautiful, surrounded by a garden - very cozy atmosphere. We were allowed choose a menu ourselfes out of five options and it was delicious. Before the class you visit the market, which is so cool to see since you have a local with you. The cooking class itself is a lot of fun and you get so many useful tips. We can't wait to cook all the recepies back home. I can definately recommend you to do Thuy's cooking class, it's a blast!

Welcoming experience
My girlfriend and I, living in Nanjing, attempted to escape Chinese New Year by taking a trip to Vietnam. Unfortunately, we were completely unaware that Vietnamese Tet is the same week. We arrived at the spa looking for massages and accidentally interrupted their New Year's party. They still welcomed us upstairs at 9:30 PM without reservation and delivered wonderful, thorough massages. The facilities were clean and professional, but no frills. If you're looking for rose petals and over priced extras this isn't your place, but if you want a great massage in a nice, simple setting we both highly recommend them. Centrally located near the Sun World complex with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby.

Amazing Ha Long Bay experience!
Ambassador Cruise great experience, Camille and Jad provided Gold standard customer service. We highly recommend this cruise! We choose the Western Style and it was a really good food. The Heritage experience is worth it! Will come back sooner.

Amazing experience! Wished we stayed longer
We had an amazing time. The staff were so lovely and helpful. Especially Linh Chi, she was very attentive in serving us and taking great group photos - we really appreciate it. Bruce Panda was very informative on our small boat rides to the cruise and activities.
