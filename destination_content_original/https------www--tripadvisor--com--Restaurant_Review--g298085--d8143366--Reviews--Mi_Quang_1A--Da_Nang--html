Savor Authentic Flavors at Mi Quang 1A: A 4-Star Culinary Experience
Mi Quang 1A offers an exceptional dining experience, earning a solid 4-star rating from me. The restaurant impresses with its authentic flavors and hearty portions. Their signature dish, Mi Quang, is a delightful blend of flavors and textures, showcasing the richness of Vietnamese cuisine. The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, making it perfect for a casual meal with friends or family. While the service can be a bit slow during peak hours, the delicious food and reasonable prices more than make up for it. Overall, Mi Quang 1A is a must-visit for anyone craving a taste of Vietnam's culinary delights.

Don’t go anywhere else for traditional Da Nang dinner
The best place in Da Nang to have Dinner!
Mi Quang was so delicious! We had a such a great time here.
The best food we have had in central Vietnam, cold cheap beer also.
We were very stoked, don’t walk past this gem.
I already want to go back for more.

Authentic Mi quang in town
Authentic local noodle (mi quang) is sold here. I tried a bowl of chicken, with the bones and feel happy with nice flavours. In the surrounding, i could find an iced coffee.

famous noodles in central vietnam
Mi Quang is the famous noodles in central vietnam,i had it last year september. ordered a special Mi Quang and fresh coconut,normally people eat Mi Quang,they will add a ban trang,so i ordered one too,wow,very big rice paper! Mi Quang is dry noodle,maybe it has soup version.the taste a bit bland for me,but i just tried once,not impressive,maybe next time will try again,the menu is simple, only Mi Quang with different ingredients,like shrimps, porks, eggs, chicken.the special one includes everything.

Good mi quang, in a professional and clean place
Good mi quang, in a professional and clean place. Not the street side experience, but not the confortable place either. Quality dishes, around mi quang. There is a com ga/cau lao place right next to it.

Quality dropped off!
I was based in Danang during 6 years since 2010 & back in 2017 and this year 2019. I’m sad to have detected a dropped off about the taste and quality of the most famous My Quang dish in town for many years.

Commandable breakfast
Having read such rave reviews I was looking forward to having the dac biet Mi Quang and ordered chanh muoi lime juice on the side.
Being a foreigner gives you a slightly different treatment in that they passed by my table several times to serve other customers who arrived after me, aren’t the smiliest and sort of sneer when you try to speak Vietnamese, don’t bring you nem ( sausage steamed in a banana leaf, here beef and spices) along directly and you have to ask for it... mi Quang was good, broth asked for a bit of seasoning but otherwise nice and flavorful, chicken was boney spine and chewy skin, portion average. I’ve only had MQ 4 times and am no expert but will keep on exploring. Do try it there if you’re around Hai Phong.

Enjoy delicious noodles in same way of locals!
In quite street of downtown Da Nang, this place is so local and friendly. Some oftions of traditional Vietnamese noodles cooked with chicken, pork or beef. Sometimes all of this is not available anymore but still happy for which you ordered.

Superb little restaurant
Lunchtime delight, 4 choices on the menu and noodles of the Da Nang region. No English here, but they helped me through how to eat the food. Should be rated a lot higher, come and enjoy.

Suits our Flavour
After a few average noodle experiences, we finally found this noodle place that all of us enjoyed! We had this as breakfast and chose "Noodles Special", which included port, shrimp, chicken and egg.

I'm going to your store. But, my travel date is February 14th to 18th. It overlap with the Tết. So I wonder when you guys don't open the store during the Tết. Tôi sẽ đến cửa hàng của anh. Dù sao thì, ngày du lịch của tôi là ngày 14 tháng 2 đến ngày 18. Nó trùng lặp với Tết. Vì thế tôi rất tò mò khi các cậu mặc áo thun và không mở cửa hàng.
