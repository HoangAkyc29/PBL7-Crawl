Flawless , a memorable stay
I have actually wrote my review on Google but Iâ€™ll repeat again as this hotel deserves the highest compliment. Probably the best resort we have stayed. We are frequent travellers. The pools are heated! I canâ€™t fault anything. The breakfast was amazing. The staff is another level. The staff in kids club Linh, Tu, Thu, amazing amazing. Amazing breakfast selections, canâ€™t fault. Just one feedback weâ€™re staying over during NYE and the buffet selections are average for USD100/pax and Pls consider to provide some child friendly meals when charging USD50++.

Immerse yourself in Bensley's design and enjoy the high-quality service.
A great experience. It happens to be the Chinese New Year. The entire resort has a very New Year atmosphere. Although the weather is relatively windy, it still does not affect this wonderful experience. I stayed at 1888 for two nights and ate at 1888. The taste of 1888 is slightly better. I feel that the salt content is high, which slightly affects the taste balance of the food. The tableside service is first-class, the sommelier is acceptable, the leaving reception is acceptable, and the children's room is first-class, especially THU, TRINIH, LINIH, and HOAI. In short, I arrived on 2/10 afternoon The children didn't want to leave in the afternoon of 2/12. At Kid's Club, we met the manager who gave red envelopes to the children.

Kids activity with Bill Benley
My sons joined an art activity at kids club today. We are so lucky to have Bill Benley who design this beautiful resort visiting and teaching about painting. My eldest son had a great talk with Bill. This is the best painting activity they joined ever. The kids club staff were helpful and zealous, I saw their clothes getting dirty by the paints but they were happy to help the kids. Thank you Bill and kid club staff Tring, Tu, Linh

Best staycation ever
I stayed at Intercontinental Danang for three days. The staff at the club lounge were incredibly friendly, and the food, hotel services, and amenities were all luxurious and excellent. There were also many monkeys around, but they weren't aggressive towards people, which was adorable. I can confidently say it was the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Throughout my stay, Steven, the club lounge manager, continuously checked if we were comfortable and if we needed anything, ensuring we had the best relaxation possible. He was extremely kind and always greeted us with a smile, which I appreciated. On the day of checkout, they gave us a monkey plush toy, which looked exactly like the long-tailed monkey I saw outside my room right before leaving. I was surprised and delighted by theâ€¦

It's wonderful to know that our staff at the club lounge provided you with amiable service and that you found the food, services, and amenities to be luxurious and excellent. We are glad that you enjoyed the presence of the monkeys around the resort and that they added to the charm of your stay. We appreciate your kind words about Steven, our Club Lounge manager, and his continuous efforts to ensure your comfort and relaxation. We will make sure to pass along your compliments to him. It's heartwarming to hear that the monkey plush toy given to you on the day of checkout resembled the long-tailed monkey you saw outside your room. We are thrilled that it will remind us of your time with us even when you are back in Korea. Your description of your experience as perfection is truly gratifying, and we are honored to be considered the best resort you have ever stayed at. We look forward to welcoming you back every winter and providing another exceptional vacation. Warmest regards, Seif Hamdy General Manager

Exquisite Experience at the Long Bar, Intercontinental Danang Resort
I recently had a visit to the Long Bar at Intercontinental Danang Resort, and it exceeded all expectations. The elegant ambiance, coupled with panoramic views of the ocean, creates a perfect setting for relaxation and socializing. The staff's hospitality, Nhi Vo and Lan Vu and others, was exceptional, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience. The mixologists at the Long Bar are true artisans, crafting cocktails that are both visually stunning and a delight to the palate. The diverse menu offers a range of options, from classic cocktails to innovative concoctions, all made with precision and flair. The attention to detail in the dÃ©cor and furnishings adds to the overall luxurious feel of the bar. The comfortable seating and subtle lighting contribute to a cozy atmosphere,â€¦

Heaven on earth
One of the best and unique hotels we ever stayed. I expected those beautiful views and design as it was advertised but I didnâ€™t expect such a high level of customer care from the staff. People are who make this place complete heaven. Citron restaurant was not just breakfast in the morning it was my meditation place. I was waking up very grumpy cos of time difference but staff and specially manager of the restaurant Mr. Hai were brining me back to life. Breathtaking view, nice relaxing music and very high standards when manager having small talk with you and understand what do you need at this participar time and understand how he can make you feel better. I experience this standards only in resorts in Maldives and didnâ€™t expect this to happen in Vietnam. I am so glad Iâ€¦

Intercontinental Da Nang is just like home!
The most beautiful resort we have ever been! The architecture is unique with a great mix of eastern and European elements. Staff are extremely professional, responsive and attentive! Food at the restaurants are all delicious but Citron is the best place for dining for our family. Lots of delicious Vietnamese dishes! Mai Huy served us a couple of times. He is warm, knowledgeable about the food and he is such a great photographer! Will definitely refer to friends and might come back again!
