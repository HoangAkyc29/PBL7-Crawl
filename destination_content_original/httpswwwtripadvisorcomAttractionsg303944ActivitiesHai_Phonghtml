Less crowded = more tranquil, equally picturesque but maybe less things to do
Lan Ha Bay has been for few years now - the less famous cousin of Ha Long Bay.
Ha Long Bay has been famous mainly for its boat tours among rocks in the valley, kayaking and caving - and technically, Lan Ha Bay has all of those but because it was about an hour away by car/ferry, it sees a lot less guests.

Pros:
Less tourists truly means more tranquility. You won't see, and especially not hear blasting Vietnamese music competing against another boat blasting 1980s Western music. A lot less rubbish floating around in the waters here too. You can truly enjoy the peace like how Ha Long was about 15 years ago. The fishing villages and rock formations like Ba Trai Dao aka "Three Peaches" beach and "Big and small turtles", were pretty cool too compared to the famous "chicken" rock formation in Ha Long. Plenty of unmarked beaches you could land your kayak on and enjoy your own "private beach". Prices were good too - less than 50usd per person for a full day's tour, and we even had a private junk boat for our group of eight for that price.
Cons:
Somehow with less competition, the boats tours provided here may be less equipped and even most of the ships' crew here don't speak English at all. So while I remembered doing a caving tour with a well-spoken English guide bringing us through secret ways within the cave 15 years ago, such caving experience wasn't available here at Lan Ha Bay at all. The crew communicated mainly by just slowing down, and pointing at perhaps 3 to 5 rock formations and looking blur when we asked questions in English. Boats here also seemed less impressive, and less well-maintained.
Getting to Lan Ha Bay:
Book boat tours online - Ventures, Serenity, or Sailing Junk like us.
Or if you're really the carefree and adventurous sort - go to the Ben Beo Harbor pier at Cat Ba island early in the morning before 830am and you'll find there are probably numerous boat tours available you can still join (there are offices right there at the pier), or even engage a smaller boat that can bring you around for a day.
Overall:
If peace and undisturbed beauty is what you're after, Lan Ha Bay is better.
If you're after luxe and multiple experiences, probably do BOTH Ha Long and Lan Ha bays, and get a luxury boat tour company to bring you around.

Cat Ba National Park - worth visiting
We spent 3 days on Cat Ba Island and half-day trekking at Cat Ba national park.
With the entrance fee as 80.000 Vietnam dong, you can visit the forest part, climb to Ngu Lam Peak and Trung Trang Cave. The hike to the top of Ngu Lam Peak is really nice and takes about 45min one way with quite steep stairs. The view from Trung Trang cave is breathtaking, too.

Cave, requires more explanatory commentary
A cave,despite what ihas in it,Definitely requires more explanatory sign postage.
Most of the travelers there, were loners like us,not on guided tours.
There could be much more learnt about it.
Medical services provided, how many peiple were in it at a given time, how long were they there.
iIt does not need more items things in it, but being in it with greater commentary provided can lead to a more enlightening experience.If you donot kniw anything about the war.one cannot leaarn much here.It is not self explantory...

Nice cave
Landscape is very beautiful around this area with limestone islands and islets. The Pelican cave is so nice where not touristy like the other caves. There are beautiful stalagmites and stalactites. It's worth to pay a visit to this cave.

Beautiful local village with gorgeous scenery
Our visit to Viet Hai Village on Cat Ba island came about as part of a day trip from our 2night/3 day Le Theatre Cruise through Ha Long Bay. We took a speedboat from our ship through Lan Ha Bay and to the quiet side of the Island. From there we had the choice of bicycles or electric car to get to the village 4km’s away. The scenery was absolutely beautiful and it was really interesting to see the gorgeous village which didn’t show too much tourist focus. Admittedly there wasn’t a lot to do but I still would have been happy to spend a few days just relaxing in the picturesque location and watching the world go by.
It appears that you can also book a boat from Cat Ba town to Viet Hai Harbour, then take a motorbike, bicycle or electric car (or walk) to Viet Hai Village along a 6 km forest road.
We did a video of our visit and so if you’re interested in seeing a bit more, find us on YouTube by searching ‘GregPetaSmith’ 😊

nice building
built as an opera house, with the front to the large square covered with a huge banner of oncle Ho, it is these days rather used for political rallies and other gatherings then for operas. still nice, also inside, as we were lucky to sneak in while they prepared some event.

Trung Tram Cave
Rented motorbike from accommodations. Rode to Trung Tram Cave. The Cave was interesting and scenic in many spots. 40KVND entry + FREE parking. You can pay another 40KVND (80K total) for a combination ticket, which also includes Ngu Lam Viewpoint. They are only about 2km apart.
The hike to the cave was very photogenic; with a good number of stairs.
