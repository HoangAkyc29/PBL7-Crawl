Best day trip we done in Da Nang
The trip here was not planned at all in advance but turned out to be one of the best things we did. We caught a grab from our hotel and they drove us to the parking area, the roads are rather windy but had fab views as you went up. When we arrived we saw a few monkeys wandering around which was great. Really surprised that there is no entrance fee for here. What we loved was how much there was too see, the stunning views and how quiet it was as it was so large and spread out. Happily spent about an hour here, probably could have done longer if it wasn't the middle of of day and really hot

Awe inspiring example of Buddhist religion
Great panoramic views from this sacred site of the sea and surrounding area. Many instagram photos in the courtyard around the Lady Buddha and pagodas. Unique fauna and flora combined with numerous Chinese and Vietnamese statues. Spend two hours and you won‚Äôt regret.

Must visit in Da Nang
Landed in Vietnam, took a break and got a grab car to reach this place at around 4 pm and with wonderful cloudy weather it was just mesmerizing. Lady Buddha - majestic and so blissful standing tall and visible from large parts of coastal da nang. Just so beautiful with all the trees, sculptures and pagodas. Entry is free. Plenty of parking available and getting here is no trouble at all. The view of the coastline and the beaches at sunset is eye soothing. The place is also called monkey mountains but we hardly saw any this day. Must visit !

Iconic Lady Buddha Statue!
This enormous statue overlooks the sea towards the city of Da Nang. It is the tallest statue in the area and is situated within a wonderful park village. There was no admittance charge! Also many great views of Da Nang from this point!

Beautiful statues
We loved walking around and seeing all of the beautiful statues. Lady Buddha is about 67 meters tall and we could see her from Hoi An. We did see a few monkeys running around which was cool. It's too bad people litter so much.

Da Nang highlight
The well manicured site containing a range of interesting gardens in conjunction with the Buddhist religious temples and the Lady Buddha statue. Even if you are not religious the site has much to offer in terms of architecture and garden design. The site was meticulously maintained when we visited. There are areas where there is informative material that will enable a degree of understanding of Buddhist culture. You need to have at least an hour to fully appreciate what the site has to offer. If you go to Da Nang and do not visit the Lady Buddha you have missed the best part.

A must visitüëçüèº
What a fantastic area to visit, photo opportunities are endless and the whole area is very impressive. We were advised to get there early which paid off massively, got there 7.30ish Sunday morning and pretty much had the place to ourselves for half an hour although when we were leaving it was getting busier. This is a must doüëçüèº

The intricate carvings and statues of the Lady Buddha are truly breathtaking
I found the experience to be very enlightening and calming. The place itself is a beautiful sight to behold. The intricate carvings and statues of the Lady Buddha are truly breathtaking and make for a great photo opportunity. The grounds are well maintained and the atmosphere is peaceful and serene.

And Monkeys Too
Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Lady Buddha towers over all as she protects Da Nang. She makes for a magnificent photo opportunity, as you overlook the coast and the city. I‚Äôm very glad we took the time to stop here, I would encourage anyone visiting to also do so.

Amazing Place to Visit
Nov 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples
An amazing place to visit and spend a couple of hours. We got a Grab from Da Nang and the driver waited for us and took us back to the city afterwards. Monkey mountain is here so you may be lucky enough to see some, alongside visiting the temples and statues.

Its a nice temple and worth a visit. The Lady Buddha looks nice after sunset. To many tourists because its very close to the city. There are better temples in danang without this huge amount of tourists

Viewing the Bay
Dec 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Compared to the Macau Lady Buddha this one is miles better. The whole site's grounds are well maintained. Beautiful scenery within the area and viewpoints out onto the bay. There are a lot of vantages with great viewpoints so you'll have a lot of chances to escape crowds here, as this place gets quite crowded. Also note there are large monkeys so if you're in a secluded area be mindful of your surroundings.

Definitely visit!
Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends
Although this site was only built about 10 years ago, it‚Äôs definitely worth seeing. They put a lot of time, thought and money into this shrine. There‚Äôs a gigantic Quan Yin, or as she‚Äôs know here , Quan Am, the bodhisattva of compassion. There‚Äôs also a number of beautiful Buddhist temples. The only drawback is there‚Äôs almost no signs or info that‚Äôs in English.

Be ready to take off your shoes and to cover your knees and shoulders here.

A short taxi drive from da nang beach .
Amazing Buddhist temple. Worth mentioning the scale of the statue and location on top of a hill. Also worth mentioning the pagoda.
Well worth a visit probably in th morning before it gets to busy

Practising Temple
Aug 2022
This is more of a Temple ground than a tourist site, there are people, monks and nuns chanting, it is a live and practising temples.
It is also very hot here, remember to bring an umbrella, also very crowded.
There are good views of the ocean on certain points of the temple.

Impressive Statue

The statue is visible even miles away. The place is mostly visited by worshipers and tourists alike. The view from the hill is magnificent. You could appreciate the coastline of da nang from the top. A must place to see in the city

Beautiful Statue and Temple Grounds
Mar 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family
Below the lady buddha on road, there's a money sanctuary on the left. Monkeys come and go, but fence is to keep humans out. Cutie younger monkeys might approach you and be aware of their over productive mothers. Also, it is good to avoid eye contact with monkeys as they are it as signs of agression. When arriving at temple ground was amazed at the size of statue and temple grounds. Bonzai trees adorn the area. It was very beautiful.
