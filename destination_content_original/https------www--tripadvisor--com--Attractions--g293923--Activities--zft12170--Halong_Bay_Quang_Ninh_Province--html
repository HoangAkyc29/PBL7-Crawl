HALONG off the beaten track
We had a wonderful morning with Si from KAB Travel HaLong Bay who took us to the main tourist places of interest in HaLong as well as to local places well off the tourist track. Eating amazing chicken noodle soup in a local street side cafe and drinking Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk high up in the hills were memorable experiences.
Si was very courteous, efficient and caring. He guided me through the slippery fish market and over the busy roads. His English was excellent and he was just a lovely person to be with.
The pagoda we visited with him was the best we saw all holiday , so peaceful and calm.
I would thoroughly recommend Si and his company.

Great 3 days
3 of us all went on the 3 day 2 night tour. We all had a great time and met so many friends that we ended up catching up with multiple times after the tour. Would highly recommend this tour if your solo and wanting to make friends quick and easily. No wifi for 3 days meant everyone was always talking and socializing. The food is pretty average but the drinks are dirt cheap. Expect to have sand though everything by the end off the tour. Unfortunately the showers were also cold. The staff were great however were not as involved as you would expect. Overall had an amazing 3 days and would 100% recommend to those who love to party.

Excellent but not what I expected
Did the two day one night trip.Note you start around noon and finish around noon the following day. The boat travels through some of the islands, beautiful, then anchors before picking up anchor the following day to return. Whilst at a chor there are various excursions. Food accommodation and crew excellent what I saw was beautiful. Would do two one day excursions next time. One way or the other I would not miss.

Sad to see many PET bottle garbage
The island is named after Russian cosmonaut. This was the first stop during the tour. We were asked to choose either, hiking or swimming. We chose hiking. It was quite a tough one! It was really a hot and humid day. The stairs are quite steep and narrow. There were lots of tourists, you needed to walk carefully for up and down , not to slip or hit.
The view from top was beautiful. You get sweaty!
We saw people swimming at beach. Looked fun in such a hot day at less wave beach.
It was very sad to see tons of PET bottle garbage were not only in trash bins but also everywhere in the island. Maybe tourists brought drinks here and threw them away when finished. When we entered the cruise ship, we were asked not to bring in PET bottles. Only glass bottles were sold in the cruise ship. So there should have be no PET bottles in the island but there were.
We must behave to preserve the great nature.

Halong Bay symbol
These are two rocks emerging from the sea, however with an interesting form of two chicken fighting or kissing.
As our tour guide explained, they became a symbol o Halong Bay with many souvenirs with them.

good excursion and great view of the city !
This is the next stop right after our Halong bay cruise. The cable car ride to get to the complex was quite interesting-- as it passed a 188m point, a world-record. The ride on the big wheel, the main attraction, was great -- got to see the beautiful bay as well as the Halong city. Can spend some time to stroll around the Japanese garden too.

Awesome crew and boat
Highly recommend this ship and cruise. Small ship (only 8 cabins) but they keep you entertained! There is a cooking class, squid fishing, royal dinner, excursions to a cave and river rafting or kayaking. The staff are amazing and the food is 5 star. If you are looking for an amazing cruise, this is it! Note: we did the one night cruise.

Fabulous experience in Halong Bay.
We have done both the 3 day Halong Bay cruise with Indochina Junk (2016) & the 1 night cruise ( March 2024) and both have been excellent. We have chosen the smaller boats both times and it has been a lovely experience. The cabins were small but lovely and the food and experiences excellent. We loved the Kayaking particularly. Both trips were very well organised & the arrangements all worked well. The company goes to the much less touristy Bai Tu bay which is so much quieter & very beautiful

Quality service throughout the 2 day 1 night cruise
Excellent service from start to finish on this Orchid cruise. Cabins are top quality with amazing views of the world heritage Halong Bay.

Food excellent with good range of drinks, cocktails available at fair prices. Great service & communication from all staff, special mention to Jerry & Colada for service, communication & availability to ask questions.
Plenty of activities to keep us busy & we made good use including spa, massage, kayaking, tai chi, jacuzzi
