Discover the tunnels and grottoes within Thuy Son, the only one of the five Marble Mountains that’s open to travelers. Marvel at the Buddhist temples carved into the rock, then head to the hilltop overlook for awe-inspiring views of the city. Join a guided tour to learn more about the history of the mountains. To reach the summit, take the elevator or climb the stairs; if you choose to do the latter, be very careful as the marble steps tend to be slippery. Visit early in the morning or later in the day to escape the midday heat and beat the crowds. – Tripadvisor

This theme park is a popular day trip from the coastal city of Da Nang, about a 45-minute drive. Start with a fantastic cable car ride, catching a brilliant sunset if you arrive here late afternoon. Once you’ve made your ascent, cross the Golden Bridge, held aloft by a giant pair of hands. There are many other attractions here—don’t miss the Linh Ung Pagoda and the giant Buddha statue. Check the weather forecast before booking your tickets, as even if conditions are relatively mild in Da Nang, it can be wet, windy, and foggy at the top in the colder months. – Tripadvisor
This 2,185-foot-long bridge shaped like an undulating golden dragon is the most famous bridge over the Han River in downtown Danang. On weekend nights, the dragon comes to life in quite an unusual way: the bridge is closed to traffic, and the massive dragon head on the east end of the bridge releases bursts of flames and water in a spectacular night show. Prepare to get wet if you stand on the bridge near the head. Otherwise, you can view the spectacle from the river bank along Tran Hung Dao Street or many of the nearby rooftop bars. The bridge is usually a stop on a night tour of Da Nang. – Tripadvisor

Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture
The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is one of the first museums built in Vietnam by the French. The main building was constructed in 1915. It evokes some motifs of French colonial architecture in the early twentieth century and resembles the image of the Champa temples - towers in Central Viet Nam. Visitors will have the opportunity to contemplate more than 400 artifacts on display, including National Treasures and others representing the masterpieces of Champa sculpture in ten centuries (from 5th to 15th). The artifacts were made in a variety of materials, such as sandstone, terracotta, and metal. Grounded in various themes from fertility symbols, deities, mythical animals and architectural decoration from the Hindu and Buddhist, they express the features of cultural and religious values of the Champa people over many generations. The Da Nang Museum of Cham Sculpture is a must-see destination for visitors wishing to discover the culture and heritage of Central Viet Nam.
