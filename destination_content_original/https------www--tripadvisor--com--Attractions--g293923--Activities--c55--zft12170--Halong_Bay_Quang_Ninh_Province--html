Awesome crew and boat
Highly recommend this ship and cruise. Small ship (only 8 cabins) but they keep you entertained! There is a cooking class, squid fishing, royal dinner, excursions to a cave and river rafting or kayaking. The staff are amazing and the food is 5 star. If you are looking for an amazing cruise, this is it! Note: we did the one night cruise.

Fabulous experience in Halong Bay.
We have done both the 3 day Halong Bay cruise with Indochina Junk (2016) & the 1 night cruise ( March 2024) and both have been excellent. We have chosen the smaller boats both times and it has been a lovely experience. The cabins were small but lovely and the food and experiences excellent. We loved the Kayaking particularly. Both trips were very well organised & the arrangements all worked well. The company goes to the much less touristy Bai Tu bay which is so much quieter & very beautiful

Quality service throughout the 2 day 1 night cruise
Excellent service from start to finish on this Orchid cruise. Cabins are top quality with amazing views of the world heritage Halong Bay.

Food excellent with good range of drinks, cocktails available at fair prices. Great service & communication from all staff, special mention to Jerry & Colada for service, communication & availability to ask questions.
Plenty of activities to keep us busy & we made good use including spa, massage, kayaking, tai chi, jacuzzi

Amazing Ha Long Bay experience!
Ambassador Cruise great experience, Camille and Jad provided Gold standard customer service. We highly recommend this cruise! We choose the Western Style and it was a really good food. The Heritage experience is worth it! Will come back sooner.

"Exquisite Adventure: Alisa Premier Cruise in Ha Long Bay"
My journey aboard the Alisa Premier Cruise in Ha Long Bay was extraordinary. The ship was impeccable, and the staff were exceptionally attentive. Exploring Ha Long Bay's mesmerizing scenery and partaking in activities like kayaking and cave visits was a highlight. The onboard dining surpassed expectations, offering a delectable array of Vietnamese and international cuisine. Luxurious amenities like the spa and jacuzzi added to the indulgence. Overall, the Alisa Premier Cruise provided an unforgettable experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium Ha Long Bay adventure. Massive thanks to the wonderful crew for their exceptional service.

We had an amazing time. The staff were so lovely and helpful. Especially Linh Chi, she was very attentive in serving us and taking great group photos - we really appreciate it. Bruce Panda was very informative on our small boat rides to the cruise and activities.

Our Small Group Tour Felt like a Private Tour
We were keen to see Halong Bay but didn‚Äôt want an overnight tour or a long day tour.
This tour was perfect for us. We found it through Alex at Nom Nom travel, and even though we made a last minute decision to go, he took care of all the booking details at a great price.
The tour is worth the extra cost, over cheaper day tour options we saw, simply because you bypass all the long lines of the big group tours and skip past most of the souvenir shops. Our guide, Justin was friendly and helpful, happily answering our 100 questions. The boat itself comfortable and the crew of 3 did a great job, and we got to see a few spots the big boats don‚Äôt get into.
The lunch we were served on board was delicious, including fresh seafood and a big number of dishes. Only extras to pay for were drinks and tips (optional, but well deserved üòä).
We were picked up by limousine van at 8:45 and back at our hotel at 18:45 , so for us, this was a perfect day trip excursion. Just the right amount of time out on the water and no waiting around anywhere.

Great cruise experience
Booking with Rita cruise was a breeze, from start to finish, Tony Pham was extremely helpful and diligent in ensuring our experience was perfect. He provided continuous advice and recommendations, and was always quick to respond. It felt very personalized and we cannot thank him enough. The cruise itself was very nice, the ship was modern, the buffet had many options and food was good! John (Cuong) and his team were professional and friendly. Our entire family enjoyed this experience and would highly recommend Rita cruise and booking with Tony!

Excellent trip
Excellent service from all staff. Both Ha, Jimmy and Hanna were very professional and friendly. I am vegan and they did a fantastic job preparing food for me so I had enough to eat! The room was beautiful and the balcony was a great place to have a glass of wine. Kayaking was fun as well. We had a great time and definitely recommend.
