Market with a Mekong cruise
We did a cruise trip for 2 days from Caibe. Tour finished in Cantho and we visited the market. I could not see many boats, but good enough to see. People move to live on land and the market is mostly for tourists.

The monastery.
To visit Truc Lam Phuong Nam Can Tho Zen Monastery, take a look around from the outside to the inside, the first highlight of the temple is a very large area with many large items such as: the three-way gate, the main hall, the bell tower. , drum tower, post hall, ... all share a common shade of red-brown tile with large wooden pillars and the foundation is made of solid stone.

The high and wide gate is built in the way of a curved attic, roofed with red tiles. In the middle of the gate is a wooden sign engraved with gilded braille "Southern Truc Lam Zen Monastery"; Below the signboards on both sides of the gate are two statues of Vi Da Ho Phap (Mr. Thien) on the left and a statue of Tieu Dien Dai Si (Mr. Evil) on the right. In general, the three entrances to the monastery are very eye-catching at first glance when exuding a majestic, modern but very traditional image.
Through the entrance gate is a spacious bright red brick courtyard leading to the main hall, visitors will see 2 rows of marble statues of Arhats placed in parallel. At the foot of each statue are engraved the names of heroes who have defended and built the country.

Interesting insight into how chocolate is made by hand
Our visit to Muoi Cong Cocoa Farm was quite the eye-opener. It was our first time seeing chocolate made by hand, and this place offers a thorough look into every step of the process. Tasting 100% pure chocolate straight from the press was unique, and seeing the entire process from bean to the final product was fascinating.
They also offer a choice of hot or cold cocoa. If you're curious about chocolate making, this farm is definitely worth a visit

Small but beautiful Vietnamese Pagoda
Wednesday afternoon on the 9th January and we visited this Vietnamese Pagoda, which is situated near the centre of Can Tho. Our visit was scheduled as part of our Tour, and our Guide, Ha, was most knowledgeable and informative.
In the grounds in front of the Pagoda is a large statue of a smiling Buddha and nearby a statue of Guanyin, Godess of Mercy. The presence of male and female Dieties symbolises that all are welcome, both male and females. That is one of the major difference between a Vietnamese Pagoda and other Temples, which are exclusively for males.
At the front of the Pagoda are 3 gates, 2 smaller ones on either side of a larger one, the large gate is so that the Gods can pass through and the 2 smaller ones for guests and worshippers to pass through.
This 2 storey Pagoda, is a striking building with its red pillars, roof tiles and ornate roof. On the ground floor is the main Shrine is located along with other religious items. We also climbed the small staircase to the first floor where the old bell is housed along with more religious items and images.
To the side of the Pagoda is a tall ornate tower, which is the tomb of a Monk.
On entering the Pagoda, visitors are asked to remove their shoes and to wear appropriate clothing.
A beautiful Pagoda well worth a visit.

Nice old house with beautiful garden
There were so many antiques and things in this house all over the place. The house had nice carvings, and murals, etc. We enjoyed also walking around the beautiful garden. Just lovely. There was also a artist with a boutique of his pictures to purchase.

Khmer Pagoda
Many of the Hotels and tourist attractions in Can Tho City, are in the Hai Ba Trung road area, and its surroundings. A good planning before visiting this site, helps to maximise the available time at hand and avoids unnecessary traveling up and down searching for a missed attraction.
We were staying at Kim Too hotel which is also located on Hai Ba Trung road. We planned and followed a circuit on foot as follows.
Kim Too Hotel→ 150 meters→ Ong Temple → 20 meters across the road → Ho Chi Minh Memorial → 90meters → Niem Kiew Wharf → 300meters → Can Tho Night market road → 500 meters→ Phat Hoc Temple→ 90 meters across the road → Munirang say temple → 250 meters→ Tarot Museum → 500meters→ Bao Tang Quan Khu 9 (War Museum) → 260meters→ Can Tho Museum→ 230meters→ Kham Lon Can Tho ( Prison Provinciale-Colonial Prison)→ 500meters → Ninh Kieu Pedestrian bridge ( Cau di bo Ben Ninh Kieu) → 400 meters →Kim Too Hotel.
It was following this scheme that we reached Munirang say Temple.
This is a golden coloured Buddhist temple just across the road from Phat Hoc Buddhist temple and decided to check it out. It is built in the Khmer Angkor architecture style and is very impressive.
We explored the ground floor and then walked up the stairs to the area of worship. You need to remove your shoes to enter the area of worship where the buddha is sited on a golden throne on an altar.
The monks were welcoming and helpful. We spent about 30 minits here.

Colourful nighttime experience
Ninh Kieu pedestrian bridge ( Cầu đi bộ Bến Ninh Kiều) connects Ninh Kieu wharf and Cai Khe Islet. The bridge measures 199 metres long and is 7.2 metres wide. It is a curved S letter-shaped structure, constructed in concrete and metal.
Wednesday evening 9th January we walked across the bridge we were going to Cai Khe Islet to pick up our boat for the Victoria Boat - River Night Cruise.
The bridge looked really spectacular which was illuminated with morphing lights across the bridge. The main focus was the two large metal lotus flowers (National flower of Vietnam) which were lit up by an array of coloured lights. From a distance it appeared like a funfair
As part of the cruise we did sail under the bridge. It was easy to see from a distance but was quite a sight to sail under.

English language Mass in Can Tho City.
As I thought that major cities in Vietnam such as Hanoi and HCM, there will be English language mass in its major cathedral, we came to this place the first time we came to Can Tho. A priest in this Cathedral informed us that English language Mass is celebrated every Sunday at 9:00 AM not far from here, at the Catholic Bishop's Residence Can Tho (Tòa Giám mục Cần Thơ) 12 Nguyễn Trãi, Tân An, Ninh Kiều, Cần Thơ. In there, there is an open-air church near the gate, but the English mass is held further inside the compound in a small chapel. You will get to meet other Catholic Expats in Can Tho City and some occasional tourists.
