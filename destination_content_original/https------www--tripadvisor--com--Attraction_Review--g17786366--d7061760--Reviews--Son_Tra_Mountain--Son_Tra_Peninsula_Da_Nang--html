Be prepared when visiting Son Tra
Seems that this is not a favorite for .ost people, as there are only 2 reviews. It does require some planki g and forethought, though, and the experience can be amazing if you are mildly adventurous. Son tra is a Peninsula off the main drag of Danang, and is probably one of the most natural and splendid to visit in the area. It has one of the most spectacular pagodas (one of 3 in the area, all called Linh Ung Pagoda, the most peaceful place with a stunning view. The Lady Buddha statue which is considered as the tallest one in Vietnam (67m high, 35m lotus diameter, equivalent to a 30-storey building). The venue features the most unbelievable number of bonsai trees, all in pristine condition. Worth a visit and one of the highlights of our visit to Danang. The rest of the peninsular is beautiful and you can stop off along the road at some of the infrequented beaches along the way. If you're planning g to visit the entire area, you'll need to either arrange a driver/taxi or use a motorbike with gears, and automatic bikes are prohibited üö´. Stop off at one of the beaches along the way and enjoy local cuisines and clear swimming waters. Here are some tips though to make your journey more enjoyable: 1. Pack sunscreen and a hat. You can easily burn. 2. Stop off at places that seemingly they have a path or off the beaten track. These are the best stop offs. 3. Hire a bike with great or a taxi to get around. You can only go so far on a scooter. 4. Take water as there are no shops. 5. Wear slops to the Pagoda, as you take your shoes off a lot. 6. You won't be able to get to the 'out of the way beaches' unless you're prepared to walk a long distance.

fairies‚Äôs landing place
Son Tra Peninsula is famous for its plentiful plants and fauna as well as the attractive scenery. It is said that fairies used to come here for singing, dancing and playing chess so Son Tra is also called Tien Sa, which means Fairies‚Äô landing place.there are a lot to see here, like monkey path, Linh Ung pagoda, Giant banyan tree, Son Tra View Tower, chess board peak and so on.i only visited the pagoda.i visited it on 11 September, that time i took grab bike to here,after visiting,i walked to the beach just before B√£i t·∫Øm Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng on foot. actually, i planned to walk to my khe beach,but felt very tired, i changed my mind, and called grab bike to take me to the pink church of Da nang.

Heaps of monkeys at midday, no monkeys at night. Great place to visit
Fantastic area. The lady Buddha was beautiful to see, and the gardens are filled with many other wonderful sculptures and buildings. It was free to enter. We arrived at 12 and left at 1:30 and saw heaps and heaps on monkeys and the view was amazing. We went back at 17:00 and saw zero monkeys / no monkeys. Maybe they only come during the early morning/middle of the day! Either way both times was spectacular. And lady Buddha was even better at night glowing.

Nice to see, not much to do
Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family
As far a crowed drawing tourist attractions go son tra mountain has it made. Yet there is nothing to do besides take a few photos, getting a good one not polluted with hundreds of people is not so easy. If you really have nothing els to do or get bored of the beach this would be a good afternoon excursion.

A must visit mountain of Da Nang - Son Tra
Aug 2022
Tranquil nature spot with charming view.
A lot of monkeys near the white statue pagoda.
I came there by a motorbike in August, the sun was quite strong in the morning so I came back in the afternoon. Fresh air and sunset view from the pagoda were amazing!

Nature in it's best, just at the edge of the city
Feb 2020
we visited the peninsula several times on bright days. we visited several viewpoints, and we had nice walks in the forest.
the only thing we failed to see, is the endemic monkeys living there. we like to see them very much.
in all, they were worth visits and it is highly recommend.

Monkeys at Peace
Jan 2020
We went for a morning walk up the hilss with two locals we befriended whilst there. Best way to see the monkeys as cars make too much noise. You can stop on the road and see them in the trees. Very peaceful place and so close to the city.

So it's closed at the very top but there is some Nice garden space at the top and a chance to enjoy the great coast scenery. Stop on the way up or down for a drink in one of the water facing cafes

Was there in 1967.....a different world then.
Feb 2017
I spent almost 9 months on top of Monkey Mountain. I was 19 years old and didn't know any better.Who knew my president would lie to me and millions of other young men and women. I went back 12 years ago but he mountain was closed to tourists. It still rises above Danang as it did, but nobody's shooting any more. Returning to Danang was an experience that I will always remember. To my fellow vets, go back if you can.

Stunning views

You get stunning views from the mountains. You see the beautiful coastline of Da Nang city and nights views are even more stunning.
A must visit place.

Monkey Mountain...Then & Now
Jan 2016
I served in the US Air Force from 1966 to 1969 and spent almost the entire year of 1969 with the 555 Red Horse Heavy Construction Squadron in Vietnam. Last January I returned to Vietnam for the first time since 1969. During my tour of duty, I spent time on projects in many different parts of Vietnam. I spent over two months in Da Nang and visited Monkey Mountain several times. Here are some photos from 1969 & 2016. Da Nang has gone through tremendous change in 47 years.
