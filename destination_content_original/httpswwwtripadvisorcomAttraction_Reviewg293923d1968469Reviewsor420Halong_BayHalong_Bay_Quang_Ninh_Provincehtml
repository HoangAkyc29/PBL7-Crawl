Howard‚Äôs visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Other wordly
Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Halong Bay is a stunning destination with unspoiled nature, breathtaking views, and luxurious cruises. It is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. The scenery is simply stunning and the luxury cruises make it even more enjoyable. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Being a world heritage alone should entice you for at least a day trip from Hanoi. Truly astounding the natural scenery. Unfortunately certain tourist don‚Äôt respect nature with plastics seen in the Bay. I do hope the authorities andboat operators take a more stern position and fine those who litter.

Tourist trap
May 2019
We did one of the cruises here that are so popular and they all seemed to do the exact same basic thing. There was this beach with 1000 tourists and it was so loud and there was no space or peace and at one point some of the employees started playing sand soccer and nearly decapitated a couple people. The caves were also quite bland. If you‚Äôre going to visit Halong bay, I would recommend not partaking on the cruise.

Not worth it
May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples
We did a two days one night cruise in Halong bay (3star). I am very disappointed..
Extremely touristic, super crowded, noisy and not relaxing at all. Even at night the boats have their engines ON to support the electricity on the boat such as air conditioning inside the rooms which is completely pointless. I am sure that everyone has seen these nice pictures on this bay from top but it is not so great from the see level. It is definitely a very special place but cruising it is not suggested.

Don‚Äôt underestimate the high number of average and poor recommendations given!!

You have to go!
Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends
I was so excited about going on a cruise here. I was so shocked regarding the amount of people to be fair, there‚Äôs busy and then there is chaos! This was chaos around the area where you embarked and disembarked. Keep sight on the people that you are with as you can easily loose sight of them. It is definitely worth doing at least once. I would not want to do it again as once you have seen it you have seen it. It is a fabulous sight to see and to wake up on the water in kind of magical. I wished we had chosen a better boat and paid a little more. Saw some magnificent hawks whilst there too, which was my highlight! I would not go again, like other places I have visited due to the massive amount of people there at the same time. But if you have not seen it you really should.

Not as I expected
First, the water in the bay was dark and murky. Next the scenery was not as colorful as you see in websites and brochures. Lunch that was served in boat was good though. The tour was a good experience but I will not do it again.

Beautiful but overrated
Yes it is beautiful but it really has become an industry that makes too much of its reputation for being the must-see place in Vietnam. Given that you spend quite a lot of time travelling and the cost is high, the overall experience it adds to your holiday isn't that great. There are plenty of other beautiful places in Vietnam (if it's a choice between this and Ninh Binh I would definitely choose the latter).

So beautiful yet needs some love!!!
Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family
Halong Bay is so beautiful but I believe Coron Philippines is much more beautiful. The limestone islands are incredible and so worth the visit. Peak season can be a zoo!!! Literally thousands of people visit this place every day and you can see what this does to its environment. We booked the tour from our hotel in Hanoi and got the full day trip. If you want a relaxing tour go for two days if you have the time. I saw no need to pay any extra charges for a tour as everyone will basically see the main sites. It‚Äôs a good 4 hours drive with a pit stop at a factory that sells marble statues to beautiful hand crafted art pieces. Our boat was quite nice with an upper deck. Food was not bad but if you‚Äôre a big eater you won‚Äôt get full. Drinks are for sale on the boat. Sad to see garbage floating in the bay while sailing through the islands. First stop you can kayak or ride a paddled boat into a secluded cove entering through a big gap in the limestone. Cool to see the monkeys. The next stop is a huge and I mean massive cave! I‚Äôve been to many caves but this was impressive. Easy steps to get upto and a wooded floor that guides you around the cave. The view upon exiting the cave is fabulous as you see the bay from high up. The last stop is a small island where you can actually swim or climb the island peak. Then the boat ride back is nice as sunset photo ops are great. It‚Äôs quite a long day and you arrive back in Hanoi around 9ish. Well worth the visit. Please don‚Äôt litter üòÄ

This place was stunning, amazing and spectacular- and compared to the chaos of Hanoi and Saigon, sitting on the top deck of a cruise boat in the middle of the bay was relatively peaceful. BUT looking at the smog, the rubbish floating by in the water, the hundreds of boats in the bay belching smoke, the hordes of tourists being herded from one place to another and the excess of concrete commercialised construction happening, I wonder how long this place can survive? As much as I was awed by the wonders of nature I was saddened by how humans can exploit such a beautiful area to the extent that they are likely to ruin it.
