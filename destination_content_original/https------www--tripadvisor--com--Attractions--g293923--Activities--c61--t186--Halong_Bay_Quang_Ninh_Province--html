Dong is a local legend and we were nothing but happy with our XR 150s. Didn‚Äôt let us down for a whole month and we really put them through hell.

Highly recommend this place for good, reliable motorbikes. Dong was also there for us 24/7 via WhatsApp although we never had any problems to report back.

Best rental ever
We were more than satisfied! We got the scooter at a fair price. He also picked up the scooter at our hotel or got us a shuttle to the hotel. We wanted to continue traveling afterwards and he helped us by bus and drove us to the bus station. In addition, he and many gave really good recommendations for food, cafe and sights. It couldn't be better!

Wonderful overnight cruise
Earlier reviews of Ha Long Bay itself mention trash. I was very pleased to see barely any trash once we got away from the port area. Single-use plastics have been banned for some time now, which will have helped enormously.
Anyway, to our trip... from our pick-up at Hanoi Opera on an extremely comfortable minibus to when we were dropped back there the following day, we thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.
The staff were excellent. The boat has 22 cabins and was full, I think. Each cabin has a private balcony, where you can sit and enjoy the views. There was a corner jacuzzi in our cabin, which would be nice if you go in winter.
There were only 5 Westerners onboard, but both the boat manager and assistant manager spoke very good English and made sure that all announcements were made in English as well as Vietnamese.
The other staff were also excellent and the service of a high standard. The food was good and plentiful - a bit too plentiful, actually. We felt guilty at having to leave so much of what was put on our table. An earlier review mentioned lack of drinking water. Perhaps that comment was acted on, as there was free drinking water with all meals, on the launch for trips off of the boat, and there to greet us when we returned from them.
The short trips off the boat are all worth doing as long as you know what to expect. The trip to Surprising Cave was our favourite. The cave is massive and the lighting shows off the features well. The kayaking is for only a short time around a small bay, which was crowded with other kayakers. The 'bamboo boat' option around the same small bay was not on bamboo boats, just large rowing boats. The swimming trip is to a small man-made beach, but it was lovely to get into the water to cool off.
My daughter enjoyed the karaoke in the evening, which had lots of Western songs to choose from. However, the best thing of all was sitting up on the top deck, sipping a G&T and watching the incredible sunset.

Best tour and guide ever!!
This tour is a must do. Ryan, the guide of the Lan Ha cruise was absolutely amazing. He was very informative, kind, and funny! This trip will take you on the adventure of a lifetime‚Äî you cannot miss it! Beautiful swimming through caves, amazing kayaking, delicious you can even see monkeys! I would highly recommend, especially if Ryan is running the tour.

Interesting activity!
After two days visiting Ha Noi my friend who traveled to Vietnam last year recommend Ha Long. It's seemed to be that I am the first traveler to book tour from Halong Bay Group Tours. We were picked up us from our hotel in Ha Noi then joined into one group of 30 other travelers who have the same trip. The tour included transportation from Ha Noi, cruise and food on Ha Long bay. Not bad full-day tour!

Just one word: Amazing!
Wow! It's amazing cruise trip in Halong Bay. We stayed overnight on the cruise and it was the right time for us to enjoy our holiday. All of us do like this trip and maybe Halong Bay will be the BEST attraction in Vietnam, highly recommended! (We booked this trip from Halong Bay Cruise Tours two weeks in advanced).
