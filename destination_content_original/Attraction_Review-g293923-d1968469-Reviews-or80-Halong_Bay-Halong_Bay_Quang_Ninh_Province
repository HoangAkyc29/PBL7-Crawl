바다에 잠긴 석회암 돌산의 아름다운 풍경
thg 2 năm 2018 • Bạn bè
하롱베이는 베트남에서 가장 널리 알려진 site입니다. 'Hạ Long'의 뜻은 '용이 내려왔다'입니다. 베트남이 중국의 침략을 받았을 때 하늘에서 용이 내려와 도와주어 그 위기를 극복했다고 합니다. 그 용이 바다에 잠겨서 수많은 바위 산이 되었다는 전설이 있습니다. 바다 위 바위 산은 베트남의 관광 site인 동시에, 베트남 민족주의를 반영한 전설이 담긴 중요한 장소인 것입니다. 바위 산은 석회암이 기반암으로, 계림(Guìlín, 중국), 닌빈(Ninh Bình, 베트남)에서 볼 수 있는 'tower karst topography' 와 유사합니다. 차별적 침식으로 인해 급경사의 바위 산이 형성되었습니다. 차이점은, 하롱베이는 바닷물에 침수되었다는 점입니다.

하롱베이는 베트남의 수도 하노이에서 버스로 편도 4시간 정도 걸립니다. 많은 여행객들은 하노이에서 1일 투어로 하롱베이에 다녀옵니다. The Sinh Tourist에서 제공한 1일 투어 상품으로 다녀왔습니다. (http://www.tripadvisor.co.kr/ShowUserReviews-g293924-d1933099-r563335881-The_Sinh_Tourist-Hanoi.html#review563335881)
항구에서 작은 유람선을 타고 bay를 둘러보면, 바다 위에 수많은 깎아지른 듯한 바위산이 있습니다. 유람선이 'Bến tàu Hạ Long'에 정박한 뒤, 작은 bamboo boat나 kayak으로 갈아탈 수 있습니다. 그리고 유람선은 'Động Thiên Cung'로 이동하여 함께 동굴 탐방을 할 수 있습니다. 석회동굴의 내부에 지하수는 더이상 흐르지 않지만, 종유석, 석순 등 신비로운 석회암 지형을 구경하기에는 적절합니다.

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Compulsory visit to Halong Bay
If you are visiting Vietnam and Hanoi, highly unlikely that you would skip Halong Bay. We booked our trip via local tour operator(Hanoi), which was expensive than Klook, but was available for next day (Klook didn't take the booking post 5pm on the previous day).
We were picked at around 8am from our hotel and took us 2-2:30 hrs to reach the port, with a mandatory stop in between for washroom/meals and shopping. We had taken the route which had the biggest cave and luxury cruise which had 3 floors.
We were treated to a good spread of lunch(limited options for Vegetarian but can't complain) and there were paid drinks available with happy hours in afternoon.
Cave: We spent around 45 mins to 1 hour at this spot as the area was huge and very very crowded. It was decent experience but nothing that would make you jump out of your seat.
Kayaking/Wooden Boat ride: We had to choose one and we choose Boat ride, if you are not confident of Kayaking, better to skip and go for boat ride as the place is crowded and we saw the folks doing Kayak getting squeezed multiple times. But if you are confident and used to doing Kayak, it would be a great experience too (as we checked with other folks who did Kayak).
The views are breathtaking and difficult to keep your hands off mobile to capture the raw beauty of the place. The place consumes you and was the highlight of the day. We were also told by our tour guide to give atleast 1$ per head as tip to the women who had taken us around.
Optional Speed Boat: There was an option to do speed boat by paying 10$/head and it was around 10-15 mins ride which was breathtaking as well. Recommended to opt for this option if you are looking for some fun and picturesque around the multiple caves and mountains of Halong Bay
Beach and Climb to view point: We stayed around 30 mins here and there are stairs to go to the top for view point. This is crowded too and there is also a mid point where you can go to, if not to the top. Top has 360 degree view vs one sided view at the checkpoint.
This was the last point and we boarded the cruise for juices and fruits (which was earlier planned at the top of the cruise, but due to high wind speeds) was conducted in closed space on the 1st floor.
We reached the port post sunset and took some good photos during our cruise time and took similar 2-2:30hrs to reach back to Hotel in Hanoi. A tiring and worthy day.
Recommend to take limousine transport for to and fro as you would spend ~5 hrs on road.
The luxury cruise have fewer people on board and better interiors and facilities vs the general ones which looked very vanilla and had bunch of people. There would not be any difference in the points covered from either cruise.
Enjoy and have a great Halong Day.

We found HALONG BAY CRUISE HUNTERS agent on TRIPADVISOR with great reviews and we were supposed to join with luxury option and the experience was OUTSTANDING and lovely, me and my family had great time, Pick up from Hanoi was smoothly even it was a bit slow due to traffic. there are many fake agents and i am sure you guys will look for a LEGIT ONE on TRIPADVISOR with authentic reviews.

Environmental disgrace
Water quality is awful, a dumping ground for the area. Signs all around telling you not to swim as it’s that bad. Not much mention of this in travel books! Nothing to do in the town, certainly not worth staying here, day trip or overnight visit at best.

The landscape its scenery essentially remains unchanged…….charming,mysterious,serene..

Too many boats creating cutting waves which ruin the serenity of this charming place
Besides this…still worth visiting,,thumbs UP!,

A stunning seascape of unspoiled nature!
Its mesmerizing seascape is a sight to behold, with thousands of limestone karsts emerging from the emerald waters. The bay is dotted with islets, caves, and grottoes, making it a paradise for nature lovers. The picturesque scenery and tranquil atmosphere make it the perfect spot for a relaxing holiday.

A nice place to visit, but I also could’ve done without it.
This experience was much more of a party boat, and less of a natural beauty excursion than I expected. Travel in the bay is somewhat restricted in where boats can visit, which means that at times they were so many boats in one area that it seemed like rush-hour. The bay itself is beautiful, but it is not a wilderness experience. I’m not saying that it’s not a worthwhile excursion, but you set your expectations to be very touristy much more crowded than anticipated.
