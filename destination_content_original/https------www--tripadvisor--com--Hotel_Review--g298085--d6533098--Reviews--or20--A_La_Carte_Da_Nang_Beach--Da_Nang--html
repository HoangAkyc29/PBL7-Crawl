Best hotel in my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
I was here on my trip to Da Nang and there's no arguing about the hotel's prime location close to the city center and right next to the beach. From the room, I could embrace the entire ocean. Not only that, the rooms here are very spacious and clean, and the breakfast is excellent. If you are a couple, you should try going to the hotel's top bar to have a cocktail and admire the sea, it's incredibly romantic. As for the hotel staff, they are exceptional. The staff is always cheerful and friendly, ready to assist, especially Rosy, who always answered my questions and provided me with great experiences in Da Nang with a smile always on her face. This is the best hotel and I will definitely come back. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

spice spa @ alacarte
Type of massage : stretch (Thai massage) Therapist : Quynh Ngoc I received a massage on the last day of my trip to Da Nang. My body was quite tired due to Marble Mountain visit, but I found myself completely refreshed when I got the treatment done. Since it's a hotel spa, it's more expensive than massage parlors in town, but considering the fact that I received the treatment at a campaign price, the high level of technique, and the cleanliness, I was very satisfied with the experience.

Great Hotel Experience
I stayed here for 2 nights in a clean and spacious room. The hotel is right across from the beach and close to the city center, making it very convenient for transportation. The staff is fantastic, always friendly and ready to assist when needed. Special thanks to Kim at the front desk who introduced me to many places to visit and market. She is cheerful and very enthusiastic. Thanks to the hotel for providing excellent services. Looking forward to staying here again on my next trip üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ

The lobby was also spacious and clean. The room was spacious, clean and I was able to spend 3 days comfortably. There is a free pool on the 24th floor, and the view is too great. The front desk called KIM helped me a lot. Thank you! When I come to Da Nang, I want to stay again.
