Excellent but not what I expected
Did the two day one night trip.Note you start around noon and finish around noon the following day. The boat travels through some of the islands, beautiful, then anchors before picking up anchor the following day to return. Whilst at a chor there are various excursions. Food accommodation and crew excellent what I saw was beautiful. Would do two one day excursions next time. One way or the other I would not miss.

A bridge that dominates the area
This gateway bridge into the Halong Bay area. You have incredible views of the Karst limestone jutting out of the Bay. The bridge is one of five of its kind a single strand prestressed cable stayed cable bridges.

Not Crowded in the Morning
The best area we visited was part of our cruise, mostly because it wasn't crowded. The main reason it wasn't crowded was because we went in the morning. The area is clean to a good standard.

Fascinating floating village of fishing families
We visited the Cong Dam Floating Fishing Village as one of several activities we did each day on board the Indochina Junk Princess during our 4 day (3 night) trip. The beauty of mountains and sea are magnificent -- Cong Dam is an old, small village, which has retained its traditional fishing culture with a population of about 120 people.
It was very interesting to be rowed around the village and see the houses and fishing boats and to get out of the boat and visit the small museum and school they have. It is fascinating to see how very differently some people live and work and how they have adapted to their environment.
The village is pretty far from the mainland and so the Cong Dam area is pretty isolated from the normal tourist routes.
While we were there we also visited the Pearl Farm that is there. It was fascinating to see how they implant the oysters and "farm" and harvest the pearls. The floating jewelry store we visited would challenge many a store on Fifth Avenue in NYC!

200,000 banknote
All the Vietnamese know this island because this place is drawn at the back of 200k banknote. I personally thought fighting chickens rocks were impressionable than this island. You can’t land here but see from distance. It maybe fun to take photo with the note.

Definitely worth breaking up the trip
This was definitely worth breaking up the trip for, and made a welcome change from the usual shopping centres in town. This one is not far from the Vincom shopping centre where the taxi’s normally drop tourists, which was interesting. It’s right in the middle of town, but quite hard to find, as its down a side street which looks really local. The have skirts and pants which are free to borrow if you’re wearing shorts or a sleeveless top (just look to the right hand side of the compound as you walk in). It’s really worth a visit, and we’ll probably have some footage going up on our Swearjarcoins YouTube channel soon. The temple is dedicated to the mountain gods, and the goddess of mercy.
