A nice sandy beach but...
My Khe Beach is a really nice beach with soft & white sand, temperate waves. There are several food and beverage options along the scenic walkway. Maybe because the beach is close the city centre with lots of hotels & residential nearby, it is too crowded...

Nice beach
The beach is kept clean and the water is crystal clear. There are also plenty of great restaurants nearby, making it easy to enjoy a delicious meal after a day of sun and sand. My Khe Beach is a great place to spend a day or two, and I highly recommend it.

Pretty beach on the DaNang shoreline.
Clean white sand beach with palm trees and mild waves. Picturesque panoramic view showing SonTra mountain awaits for shutterbugs. Beach usually crowded around 5pm after it cools down some.

Beach life at its best
Beautiful beach. We were staying in one of the hotels facing the beach and every moment was mesmerizing. Beautiful sunset with people hitting the water as early as 5.30, exercising, aerobics, zumba classes and more. In the evening with all the lights coming on and the food stalls, option to rent chairs and just making sand art in the clean sand - just wonderful. Life guards are always available and flags are raised to indicate when it's not safe for a swim.

The best city beach of Vietnam!
The best city beach of Vietnam! Really big and very clean (unlike other beaches). Here it is enough place for everyone, so no crowds. Luckily this part of beach os not popular among Vietnamese, so there are no people shouting karaoke, no smelly food and garbage. Comparing with other Da Nang beaches, this one is more developed with some bars and restaurants on the beach. It is really calm and peaceful atmosphere here. Highly recommend!

Beautiful and long beach
My Khe is the central beach of Da Nang city. It's a long and sandy beach, pretty wide. Many hotels line it, just across a busy street. There're many free parts, as well some where's a bar and where you can rent sunbeds. Water is shallow for long, usually with waves. Try to get up early one day before sunrise, as the beach is east oriented. Apart beautiful scenery of the rising sun, you'll enjoy many locals around swimming, practicing tai-chi, jogging, exercising.

A Gem of Da Nang
May 2020 • Family
With a coastline of 35km long from Hai Van Pass to Non Nuoc, Da nang is one of the most beautiful coastal cities in Vietnam. Closed to the city center (5km), the most popular beach My Khe is the common name of the coastline lasted 10km from the base of the Son Tra Peninsula to the Marble Mountains (Ngu Hanh Son). It's just 5km to get here from Da Nang city center and 25km from Hoi An.

Nice beach but not recommended to visit in Dec
Dec 2019 • Family
Quite a long stretch of beach with hotels and restaurant opposite it across the main road. Few restaurants available by the beach and some beach canopy / chairs too. Less tourists since the waves are quite strong with red flag on warning. Realised that there's one area where the drainage from the city flows out towards the beach and to the sea which emits quite nasty smell and surely dirty water. Didnt managed to get the photo but its easy to notice.

Expansive White Sand Beach with Coconut Trees
Mar 2019
Known to Americans as China Beach, our Vietnamese tour guide advised our group that this 20 mile long beach with beautiful white sand and coconut trees does not belong to China, and told us of the proper name. Used as a respite for American military during the Vietnam War, My Khe Beach on the South China Sea got its American nickname of "China Beach" at that time. It is considered the finest beach in Vietnam. Numerous high-rise hotels and luxury resorts line the street adjacent to My Khe Beach. Traffic was a snarled mess when we stopped for a visit. Easy to see its lure for tourists.

World class surfing beach
Feb 2020
This beach is unexpectedly beautiful besides the world class ones from Australia. It's just steps away from hotels and restaurants so it's like in Gold Coast, very friendly to tourists and local swimmers, or more precisely surfers. Sand was fine and clean, credit to the workers to maintain this beach for public. Even it does not have the depth for sandy beach, it's long enough to accommodate huge number of beach goers. Must visit even you have brought your swim wears along.

Nice and quiet beach
Not too busy and quiet beach. Great serenity. It is good for just walking along the water edge to quiet your mind. Beach itself is shallow quite a while. It feels safe and surf guard watches very carefully. It will be nice if they have shower booths there.

Don’t Call It “China Beach”
Feb 2020 • Couples
This is a long, long beautiful beach and it’s easy to see why it is so popular. The Vietnamese want people to know it is not owned by China, hence the correct name is My Khe. Great surf - one must obey the no swimming directive on stormy days.
