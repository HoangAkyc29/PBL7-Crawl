Yumo what a treat
We had an anniversary tea here it was so much fun to try the golden food we had burgers and steak all were wonderful cooked to profection and really tasty to be honest the steak and sides would have been enough on it's own as we didn't realize until after ordering the steak was going to he that big. Staff were so lovely and suprised us with a special dessert for our anniversary. Cocktails were also yummy.
We also had the golden high tea while staying there it was also delicious and fun to try the different gokden treats

Nice experience
I came here to have dinner with my husband. We had a wonderful night here. I felt the comfort and care from Phi (Restaurant Supervisor), who wholeheartedly took care of us and introduced us to delicious dishes. I feel very satisfied because of your help. Da Nang is a wonderful place that can experience a lot, I can observe the whole city.

The Chef saved the dinner.
Food was really good. But manangement really needs to step it up. They had not printed out the set menus they promoted so they ended up giving us a lap top to read it on.. pretty poor , lucky for them we were the only ones there. We had made a reservation so it wasn't like it was a surprise for them.
The set menu had 1 cocktail included, they should be clear that you have no choice since it is just ONE you can choose from- the cheapest one, of course. Just put it in writing., sell your product for what it is.. marketing 101
Food was exellent and service friendly. Would come back for the food.

Great Friend R√©union Party
First time trying this restaurant in Danang for a friend reunion trip. I was so surprised to find a fine dining restaurant with reasonable price. The night view is super. The food can dare to say one of the best of the best in Vietnam. We had a group of 11 and it was a great night. Super night view outdoor and super cool decor indoor. Is your regret if you not try this place out when you in Danang. I will be back.
