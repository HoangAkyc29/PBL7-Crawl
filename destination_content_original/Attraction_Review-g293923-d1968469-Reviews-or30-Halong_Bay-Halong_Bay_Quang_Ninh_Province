Kỳ quan của thế giới
thg 4 năm 2021 • Cặp đôi
Hạ Long đúng là một kỳ quan của thế giới. Nếu bạn chỉ đi trên bờ hoặc cùng lắm là đi tầu tiếng thì không cảm nhận hết được vẻ đẹp của vịnh. Bạn phải ngủ đêm trên tầu, tham gia khám phá và chèo kayaking,... thì bạn mới đủ thời gian để cảm nhận được sự tuyệt vời của tạo hoá đem lại cho Hạ Long.

Tách biệt với cuộc sống công nghệ
Vịnh Hạ Long nghĩa là Vịnh nơi mà rồng đáp xuống, nơi sản sinh ra rất nhiều những đảo/ hòn nhỏ. Du thuyền sẽ đi qua rất nhiều và bạn như lạc vào một thế giới trong cổ tích vậy. Nơi đây không sóng điện thoại, không tv,... nơi bạn hoàn toàn sống không còn phải cắm mặt vào điện thoại hay máy tính nữa.

May mà đợt nghỉ vừa rồi đi Hạ Long, vừa đẹp vừa an toàn. Trên tầu chỉ có mấy chục người, lại đi trên vịnh nên rất an toàn. Gió biển, đồ đc vệ sinh, không phải chen chúc nhau như các điểm du lịch khác.
Cảnh thì đẹp tuyệt vời.

Tuyệt đẹp 😍
Phải nói là tuyệt đẹp. Đặc biệt là khung cảnh lúc hoàng hôn và lúc bình minh. Trong những ngày thời tiết đẹp, lúc hoàng hôn là thời điểm bạn có được những bức ảnh hiếm có. Khung cảnh trở nên lãng mạn và kỳ vĩ. Hai ngày trên Vịnh qua là quãng thời gian tuyệt vời với mình nhưng cũng trôi qua thật nhanh.

Đi từ Hà Nội giờ vô cùng thuận lợi, chạy thẳng cao tốc Hà Nội - Hải Phòng - Quảng Ninh là tới. Mà cao tốc lại rõ xịn. Đồ ăn ngon, đặc biệt là hàu. Nhiều khu vui chơi như Sunworld, tắm khoáng Quang Hanh.
Ngủ được 1 đếm trên vịnh quả thật là lý tưởng.

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

For those who love sunrise and sunset…
Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Magical, stunning, calming. We swam, cruised overnight, kayaked, walked to the caves, fed monkeys, relaxed.
(Other reviews complain about rubbish in the water, there was none, and it wasn’t too busy or crowded either).
Not to be missed.

How to Escape Tour Crowds
Jan 2024 • Couples
Majestic Place no matter what day/night cruise ship you decide to take. But if you're wanting to avoid crowds at the main tourist spots like Titov island etc you have to go before 12pm otherwise your gonna just be with every other tour group. Unless your group reaches there before the others you'll spend an hour in queues. You can't see anything at night as there's no lights on the islands so spending the night makes little difference.

Understand what you will get
A two day one night typical “cruise” will give you 22 hours in the bay. With up to 12 hours of darkness you’ll see the bay for just over 10 hours. The cruise boat you booked will be moving in the bay for 2-3 hours, and there will be another 2 or so hours moving on a small day boat for excursions.

There are three groups of boats, one for each of Ha Long, Lan Ha and Bai Tu Long Bay. Only the smaller Halong bay registered boats can dock at Halong Bay harbour. The others are reached by a small day boat.
Each cruise boat has a designated point A where they anchor overnight and a point B they go to during the day. Arriving at lunch time you will move very slowly from A to B, anchor and go on an excursion, then move back from B to A to anchor overnight.
There will be another excursion in the morning, then you’ll go back to shore by the day boat, or on the cruise boat if it’s one for Ha Long bay that’s small enough.
This applies to most cruises. Some cruise boats that are smaller move about more because they have more flexibility and don’t use a day boat for excursions. By small I mean under 10 cabins.
Relatively few people book a 3 day 2 night cruise. If you do on one of the larger more luxurious boats they don’t change their itinerary but send you of Kayaking and swimming on another small day boat for the extra day. You will move around your chosen bay a little more, but maybe not a lot. Each night will still be at the cruise boats point A.
The land/sea scape is stunning in good weather. In grey cloudy weather with low visibility it’s still very atmospheric. But the boats, especially the small ones, are not brilliant at keeping you warm in winter.
If you don’t go in an excursion from the bigger boats you will see the tenders arriving with laundry, food and to pump out the waste.
The trip from Hanoi is longer than you think. It’s 2.5 hours drive in Google maps, but it’s 4 or more when you figure in multiple hotel pick ups, the obligatory stop at the pearl market, and the wait at the quayside until everyone has arrived.

Great trip!!
Captivating scenic landscapes awaited us, though December brought chilly winds. Opting for a day trip, our family, each at USD60, arranged through our hotel, experienced a seamless journey with an 8 am hotel pickup and an 8:30 pm return. The coach ride from Hoan Kiem to Ha Long took approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes. The Ha Long Bay cruise, including a buffet, spanned 1 hour and 30 minutes, featuring the Surprising Cave as the first stop. A 15 to 20-minute speed boat ride (additional cost of 240K dong each) followed, complementing the bamboo boat, included in the day trip package. The adventure continued with the exploration of Ti Top Cave before returning to the port.
