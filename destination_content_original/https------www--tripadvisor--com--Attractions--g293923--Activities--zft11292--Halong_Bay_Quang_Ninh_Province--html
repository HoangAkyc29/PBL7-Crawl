A bridge that dominates the area
This gateway bridge into the Halong Bay area. You have incredible views of the Karst limestone jutting out of the Bay. The bridge is one of five of its kind a single strand prestressed cable stayed cable bridges.

Good place to relax
I have to say that it was so crowded when I came there. It's hard to find a quiet place for sunbathing! Close at 6pm!

Nothing that can’t be seen anywhere else
A small market focussed on tourists. Nothing special there but a good place if you want to buy a last minute souvenir or fake sportswear
