We loved the trip and our guide Vu was very nice. He showed us a lot and explained all our questions. His English was great and it was a great experience overall.

Personalized food tour!

I had such a blast with Vu! He is so sweet and really thoughtful about how he runs his tours - I mentioned there was a food I wanted to try and he changed up the plan to accommodate me! He took me to places I definitely wouldn’t have known about on my own, and at nearly each place, he took me to where the dishes were made so I could learn the process. I would absolutely urge anyone to book this experience!!

Great guide - Mr. Trấn Nguyễn. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
Fantastic. One of my favourite tours in Vietnam so far (this is my second time visiting the country).
The main reason for my experience was my outstanding tour guide Trấn Nguyễn.
He is knowledgeable and so much fun to talk to. I also learnt some interesting insights about Vietnamese society today.
He took some amazing photos of me which I will treasure.

Good way to explore the Hoi An countryside!
Friendly and knowledgeable guide. Activities well spaced out. Good mix of cycling, bamboo boat ride, admiring the country side and crab fishing!

Do it!
Outstanding food tour that took me through alleyways that would have gotten me lost. It was great to sample such good food and seeing a bit of the back alleys of Hoi An.
