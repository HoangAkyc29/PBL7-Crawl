Great Hotel
I stayed at the hotel from 29/10/2019 to 01/11/2019. Absolutely phenomenal experience from start to finish, the reception staff were lovely and spoke fantastic English. They explained the services they offered with any pressure. The rooms we were given where on the 17th floor and had an amazing view of the city (dragon bridge) and the beach. The room was massive. The hotel arranges a bus journey to Hoi An & Hue we opted for Hoi An which was fantastic. The rooftop pool was as stunning as the pictures suggest. one of the best hotels I stayed in while in Vietnam.

Hotel service was good. Room is very spacious (as seen from the illustration). Hotel staff is very helpful and polite. We enjoyed our 3 nights here. The hotel has a good view and is just a 2 minutes walk from the beach.

It was a very amazing stay. Nice view, good-service staff especially front desk. I arrived hotel early in the morning after long flight, I thought I was supposed to have my luggage kept at reception but one of the staff there, Ms Houng ( hopefully i dont spell her name wrong) offered me an early in. Appreciated it and I definitely come back.

Thank you
A great hotel for the holidays in Danang, a la carte. Sea view, nice rooms, handsome and beautyful staff. I know Danang is famous with the Dragon Bridge. But thank you to an employee named Lien who told me it can spit fire and spray water on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. I watched it and it was awesome. Thank you very much.
