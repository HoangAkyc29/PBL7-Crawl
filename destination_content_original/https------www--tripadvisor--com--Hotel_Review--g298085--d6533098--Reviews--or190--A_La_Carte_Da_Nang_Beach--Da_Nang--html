Staff are helpful and friendly
The staff are friendly and helpful - Ms. Lien. The breakfast is also good here. There are many varieties of food, Chinese, Vietnam and Western. I love the vietnam noodle the best. The view at night is beautiful if there is no fog. It really depends on your luck. We would recommend it to our friendd.

view was good.
the view of the beach was good and the room was neat, too. But the infinity pool was a little small. They were very kind and had a beautiful smile. The biggest advantage is that the beach is near. I had a good time.
Xin ch√†o perieunsil, Thank you for your wonderful review! We are very happy to hear that everything was alright during your stay and that you appreciated all our services. We look forward to having you with us again in the near future. Sincerely, The A La Carte management team.

Good location but unprofessional staff and services
The hotel is just right in front of the beach so its its highest advantage. In general, its overpriced. The infinity pool is under maintenance without any prior notice to guests. Check-in and check-out process took too long without any reasons. Staff kept receiving request but no futher actions taken. Room is deisgned as an apartment with various types of kitchen equipment, then most of them could function normally. For example, the auto coffee machine is provided without the coffee capsules.

Sincerely, The A La Carte management team.

Best afternoon view
The rooftop bar and pool is a must visit, the hotel seems generally busy and so it should be, right on the beach. If you are on a short stay in DaNang and you feel like a drink in the afternoon I would say consider here it is really good.

disappointment
frankly speaking the only reason i book this hotel was for the pool, since we are not fond of swimming at the beach since it is open waters. but it was under maintenance for my whole duration of the stay and it was definitely a scheduled maintenance and would have been nice when the hotel sends guest a email inform us about it. even the kids club was closed (1 of it) even though we didnt need to use it at all. But it just shows that everything is under maintenance. The staff just swiftly talked about it and offered us alternative at the beach... wait a minute: the beach is not an alternative since it is there already and i know when i booked it, not helpful at all. And you have to be charged for every single thing, i mean i am not saying it is expensive but i need to draw my‚Ä¶

I would like to express my most sincere apologies for your unpleasant experience and, I was extremely disappointed to learn that we did not extend our usual warm and caring service during your stay. We value all of our guests and will try our utmost to extend our usual warm and caring service at all times. Each and every associate at A La Carte Da Nang Beach is fully trained to provide dedicated service excellence but regrettably, we seem to have fallen short of our usual high standards on this occasion.

Wonderful location
We stayed in the ocean view suite for 3 nights for a second time and once again, the room was great and very spacious with wonderful beachfront views. The rooftop pool and bar was opened to the public, so you can come and enjoy one or two drinks here. The pool was peaceful and relaxing and we could find a free lounge to tan. We had ordered room service for lunch and had a very good, authentic and affordable meal. We also bought spa packages which was pleasant and relaxing for our family. All in all, our stay was wonderful and we'll sure be staying here again next time.

Nice hotel‚Ä¶.
A La Carte is a lovely hotel, nice rooms, excellent service and great location close to the beach. I got the room with ocean view, which is just spectacular. The hotel staff are friendly, accommodating and very helpful. The restaurants serve good foods and get everything I need for breakfast. Although I only stayed here for 1 day for business trip, I did feel relaxed and energized.

Just ok
Right opposite the beach, the rooms are a good size. We had the 2 bedder. Customer service not the best and overcrowded with too many rude tourists. The rooftop pool looks beautiful but again is overcrowded, not many lounge options, not clean (bird poo on the lounges) and service wasn‚Äôt great. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place.
