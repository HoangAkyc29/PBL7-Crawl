Ấn tượng đáng yêu & Magical; Ghé thăm hang động đáng ngạc nhiên là tốt
thg 3 năm 2019
Hành trình đáng nhớ khởi hành sớm lúc 8 giờ sáng, do đó tránh được những đám đông lớn mà chúng tôi bắt gặp khi trở về cảng khoảng 6 giờ sau đó. Chúng tôi dừng lại để khám phá "Hang động đáng ngạc nhiên" nơi cầu thang leo lên sườn đồi dốc, tươi tốt của một hòn đảo để có thể tiếp cận hang động. Quang cảnh vịnh Hạ Long từ bên ngoài lối vào của hang động đẹp như tranh vẽ. Hang động rất ấn tượng và đồ sộ, với những lối đi được chiếu sáng uốn lượn an toàn cho du khách thông qua nội thất thú vị. Người chồng ngột ngạt của tôi không có vấn đề gì do kích thước lớn của hai khoang của hang động đáng ngạc nhiên. Sau đó, chúng tôi thưởng thức bữa trưa được trình bày độc đáo với khăn trải bàn màu trắng, sau đó quay trở lại cảng trên thuyền của chúng tôi với một mũi rồng chạm khắc tưởng tượng. Sau tất cả, Hạ Long có nghĩa là: "Nơi con rồng hạ cánh". Du ngoạn qua một số trong gần 2, 000 hòn đảo / karst độc đáo, chúng tôi hiếm khi bắt gặp những chiếc thuyền khác cho đến khi nổi lên từ các karst trong khi quay trở lại bờ. Thuyền của chúng tôi, đã được đặt qua Cổng 1 Tours, đã bị lật - khi chúng tôi đến gần khu vực bến cảng. Nhóm của chúng tôi đã bị giật một chút, nhưng tốt. Chúng tôi đã rất ngạc nhiên bởi những tòa nhà chọc trời ở xa hiện rõ dọc theo bờ biển khu nghỉ mát đang bùng nổ. Di sản Thế giới của UNESCO có vẻ hoang sơ trong khi chúng tôi đang bay trong các núi đá vôi trong chuyến tham quan buổi sáng. Vùng biển cũng yên tĩnh hơn nhiều để đi thuyền vào buổi sáng. Mang theo một chiếc mũ và quần áo ấm vì thời tiết có thể có sương mù, u ám hoặc lạnh lẽo. Chúng tôi đã dành cả đêm trước tại một khách sạn ở Hạ Long, nhưng cảm thấy rằng khoảng 6 giờ của chúng tôi trên Vịnh Hạ Long là đủ. Đây là một kinh nghiệm tuyệt vời!

A phải xem khi ở Việt Nam, và hoàn toàn đẹp. Có một chút sương mù khi tôi đến thăm, nhưng vẫn tuyệt đẹp. Có một chuyến đi hai ngày nhỏ đáng yêu trên Vịnh Hạ Long và một kết thúc tuyệt vời cho một chuyến đi tuyệt vời đến Campuchia và Việt Nam.

Vịnh Hạ Long là phải xem nếu bạn đến thăm Việt Nam. Hành trình chúng tôi chọn là khoảng 5 - 6 giờ và chúng tôi đã thấy Amazing Cave, Luon Cave và Titov Island. Đỉnh đảo Titov đáng để leo lên!

Vịnh Hạ Long, sự lựa chọn tốt nhất được ghé thăm trong chuyến đi Hà Nội này
thg 2 năm 2020 • Bạn bè
Chuyến đi đường dài từ thành phố, nhưng tất cả đều đáng để đi xe mệt mỏi và gập ghềnh một khi bạn nhìn thấy cảnh vật khi du thuyền đi về phía vịnh.

Chắc chắn là điểm nổi bật của chuyến đi Hà Nội của tôi!

Một trong những địa điểm sương mù tuyệt đẹp trên trái đất
Tôi dự đoán đây sẽ là một tour du lịch rất hay trên một chuyến đi thuyền qua Vịnh Hạ Long nhưng tôi đã chuẩn bị cho sự hùng vĩ và mê hoặc của những hòn đảo và những tảng đá nhô thẳng lên và chảy ra nếu có nước. Khi sương mù tan đi và mặt trời ló dạng, ngay cả nước bắt đầu trông khác đi trong sắc thái của màu xanh lá cây và xanh lam. Đây là một điểm rất tuyệt vời mọi người nên có cơ hội nhìn thấy nó!

Chúng tôi rõ ràng rất may mắn khi có thời tiết tốt - rõ ràng và một chút ánh nắng mặt trời và hoàng hôn đáng yêu - rõ ràng thời tiết đã không tốt như vậy trong vài tuần trước. Cảnh quan đẹp. Vì vậy, thư giãn và nhiều hoạt động ngoài trời nếu bạn muốn - đi bộ đường dài, chèo thuyền kayak, vv Một trong những phần tốt nhất của chuyến đi của chúng tôi trên khắp Việt Nam.

LỪA ĐẢO
Thật là một phần Đ BEP tuyệt đẹp của thế giới để bị nhồi nhét!
Bạn gái của tôi và tôi đã tới Vịnh Hạ Long với hy vọng tìm thấy nhiều chuyến du thuyền có sẵn trong ngày, giờ, 2, 3 giờ vì chúng tôi chỉ có một kỳ nghỉ qua đêm nhanh chóng trước khi di chuyển về phía nam và chỉ cho rằng có rất nhiều lựa chọn.
Chúng tôi đã phạm sai lầm đầu tiên khi đặt một đêm ở Tuần Châu - một địa điểm xây dựng - và sau đó đã phạm sai lầm thứ hai rất nhanh là tin tưởng người đầu tiên ném ‘hành trình cá nhân vào chúng tôi.
Trước khi bạn đọc điều này và cho rằng chúng tôi là những kẻ ngốc đáng tin cậy trả một khoản phí bảo hiểm nhỏ và nhận một chiếc thuyền cho chính chúng ta và tận hưởng mọi thứ mà các tour du lịch khác cung cấp, với một vài loại bia được ném vào.
Chúng tôi đã đến được các hang động và hoàn toàn bị thổi bay. Khi chúng tôi lên thuyền để tiếp tục, chúng tôi được chàng trai trẻ mời lên tàu cùng với các nhân viên khác và khi điện thoại của tôi được trao cho một quý ông trông già hơn, phong hóa hơn, với một tiếng càu nhàu của người Việt, anh ta biến mất sau lưng thuyền. 2 bức ảnh sau đó và tôi nhận ra chiếc túi của mình nằm ở tầng dưới với ví tiền của tôi nên tôi chạy xuống, mặc dù đội trưởng phong hóa số một đã cố gắng ngăn tôi lại, để thấy chiếc túi trẻ hơn chạy ra và túi của tôi mở ra.
Không có gì bị đánh cắp may mắn nhưng điều này đã bắt đầu một chug 2 giờ cực kỳ khó xử và khủng khiếp quanh các hòn đảo nơi chúng tôi cảm thấy vô vọng và thật lòng có chút sợ hãi.
ĐỪNG BỎ L AN CHO BẤT CỨ NÀY. MỘT KINH NGHIỆM HORRID LÀM TẤT CẢ MỌI THỨ B FONG CÁCH CẢM XÚC B BYNG CÁCH KHÔNG CHỈ BỎ QUA JUDGMENT CỦA CHÚNG TÔI.
Tôi đã có một hình ảnh của chiếc thuyền trong câu hỏi nhưng tôi chắc chắn đây không phải là con tàu duy nhất đang cố gắng cướp bóc trong khi bạn vui mừng không biết.
Chúng tôi vẫn không biết ai là người trong chuyện này - anh chàng béo ngậy đã nói chuyện với chúng tôi về việc trả 3 triệu đồng giữa chúng tôi, hoặc đó chỉ đơn giản là trò lừa đảo tình cờ trên tàu nhưng dù sao đây cũng sẽ là một câu chuyện mà chúng tôi chắc chắn sẽ kể cho thời gian dài, cho tất cả các lý do sai.

Hoàn toàn tuyệt đẹp, chuỗi đảo khí quyển. Giống như Skull Island nổi lên từ sương mù. Tất cả mọi thứ, từ những chiếc thuyền theo phong cách cổ điển đến đầm khỉ ẩn cho đến hệ thống hang động rộng lớn đã khiến đây trở thành một trong những điểm nổi bật trong chuyến đi xuyên châu Á của chúng tôi.

Đánh giá quá cao
thg 2 năm 2020
Chúng tôi đã đặt 3 ngày 2 đêm nên được gọi là du thuyền riêng sang trọng (4 khách). Không rẻ. Trong khi phong cảnh tuyệt đẹp, ngay cả khi thời tiết xấu, toàn bộ trải nghiệm ở Vịnh Hạ Long khiến tôi nhớ đến một "nhà chế biến thịt du lịch" đông đúc. Thức ăn trên tàu là tốt, dịch vụ ok, vệ sinh phòng nghi vấn, đồ uống quá đắt nhưng điều thực sự làm chúng tôi thất vọng là chính hành trình cá nhân. Ít hoặc không có thông tin từ "hướng dẫn" và khá nhiều chương trình tương tự như du lịch trên biển.
Đánh giá trung bình là vì phong cảnh nếu không sẽ là kém.
Đã đi tàu riêng trên đồng bằng sông Cửu Long trong chuyến đi trước tới Việt Nam và nó tốt hơn 100%. Vịnh Hạ Long có tên, thiên nhiên nhưng không có dịch vụ chất lượng.
Chuyến đi trong ngày từ Hà Nội sẽ là quá đủ.

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

It's NOT like the pictures
Mar 2012 • Solo
You've seen the picture in the brochure or the site: a beautiful ship sails in lonesome majesty through pristine waters past a series of limestone islands bathed in sunshine under a cloud free blue sky. Well - forget it. It's not going to happen that way. Not unless you are a millionaire, have your own vessel and can manage to convince the other 500 (that’s five HUNDRED) ships that sail Halong Bay to remain in port on “your” day out.
A little background: of the 500 ships approximately 200 are outfitted for overnight cruises, the other 300 do day cruises. On any given day there are approximately 5,000 other tourists who are visiting. Organized one or two overnight tours are sold everywhere in Vietnam. Some tour companies have their own ships and sell direct to the public. Other companies negotiate directly with the ship owners on an individual basis. In both cases the companies then make the tours available to other agents - and it seems like everybody in Vietnam has a tour agency - at a certain price which these agents can then mark up to whatever the traffic will bear. Therefore you will find that exactly the same tour will have very different prices depending on who you buy it from. The overnight tours will have different elements built in - kayaking, visit to a cave, visit to a village, whatever. When comparing prices you must make sure that the prices are for the SAME elements in each case. While clearly taking a tour is the easiest, most convenient way to visit Halong Bay you should keep in mind that you can purchase an eight hour day tour on the dock for $2.
With that background in mind my experience follows.
I purchased my tour through an agency. I wanted to “see” Halong Bay on an overnight and really wasn’t too interested in the elements that made up the package. I paid $110 for a tour on a middle class boat owned by Oriental Sails, a reputable company.
I was picked up promptly at 08:00 at my hotel in a mini van and within 15 minutes we had picked up the other participants at three other hotels and were on our way. It later transpired that three of the people in the van were on another tour run by OS so it seems that pick up was made by hotel location, not tour which is very efficient.
We were accompanied by a representative from OS who gave us a little background and a bottle of water. We then held on for dear life as the driver drove like a bat out of hell passing traffic left, right and center to ensure that we arrived at the dock in time to wait around for half an hour while we got organized. It is 3½ hours from Hanoi to the dock and after an hour a half hour “rest stop” is made to allow you to buy food, gee-gaws (including HUGE concrete statues) and maybe have a suit or other apparel items run up if you failed to buy something in Hoi An. There are also toilets.
So, after four hours, we arrived at the dock along with HORDES (see above) of other tourists. We were then told to wait while the people who were not on “our” tour were shuffled off to join “their” tour and the people who had arrived with another bus or van were joined to our group. A “guide” - I use the term loosely - maybe “minder” would be a more appropriate term - joined us and ushered us down the steep stairs to a ferry which took us out to our boat. We were 13 passengers on a boat built for 16.
We could not see more than 300 meters because of a dense fog and, I found out later, the captain was almost ready to cancel the whole excursion.
Our minder then assembled us in the dining room, gave a brief explanation of what we would be doing and keys to our rooms. At no time were we given any safety instructions. We were then served lunch at tables for four - I had a table with a very nice Scottish couple. Pick your tablemates with care as you will be sitting with them for all meals. The food for all meals was plentiful - six courses - but bland. I can understand this as the passengers come from a variety of culinary backgrounds.
After lunch we joined the 50 or so other junks and steamed out of the harbor for parts unknown as we couldn’t see a thing. OK - I had the “blue, sunny skies” with hundreds of islands in view picture in my mind’s eye but this was not to be. That having been said I came to enjoy the other “mystical islands rising out of the mist” picture which was my reality as viewed from the top deck. Taking a lemon... I could actually get a good view of the islands - if we sailed REAL close.
After about half an hour and giving instructions to a ship off our port bow which didn’t seem to know where they were going, we arrived at the first “element” of our tour - a limestone cave, There was one dock on the island so all 50 ships tried to get there at the same time, dock, unload their passengers and move on as fast as possible. Kudos to the ships’ captains as it was achieved with a minimum of delay. They’re done it before... I then joined hundreds of other passengers and walked up a steep stairway to the entrance of the cave. Our “guide” was supposed to guide us but I soon lost him in the crush of the crowd and instead picked up bits of the narrative from the guides of other groups I passed on the way. The guides were giving the usual cave “shtick” - “And here you can see a formation that looks like an elephant, blah, blah.” I have been to caves before. That having been said the cave was massive, well lighted and fitted with easily walk able paths. A very good job of highlighting its attractions. Just be prepared to share it with hundreds of people all shuffling along at the same time.
One thing I should mention here is the pollution of the water which was noticeable immediately after we left the harbor and throughout the whole trip. Plastic bags, garbage, unidentifiable floating objects were EVERWHERE. NOT what you would expect from a World Heritage Site. No way I would enter the water for a swim.
Then it was back on board the ship and after a half an hour we arrived at a dock for the second element of our tour: kayaking. There were two man kayaks for everyone but I chose not to kayak and hung out with the Vietnamese crew of our boat and some other boats and was taught a Vietnamese card game. They wanted to play for money but I declined. Another type of adventure.
After half an hour kayaking everyone was back on the boat and we steamed off to another cove where there were about 20 other ships anchored up. It was then time for “Happy Hour” and double up cocktails (food is included in tours but drinks are not) which in Vietnam means that if you buy two drinks you get one free. I stuck to one and then had dinner. There’s not a lot to do at night on a boat so I went off to my cabin which was a twin equipped with a working shower for a pleasant night. Slept like a baby!
The program stated that breakfast next morning was at 07.00 but I was the only person who showed up on time. It was eventually served at 8 and after breakfast we were off to the third and last element of our trip: visit to a fishing village. The “village” turned out to be a floating dock - one of maybe 20 - on which one could see various pens with live fish and crustaceans of various species floating in the water. Live! You could buy a fish and have the cook prepare it for dinner on the boat. A Malaysian woman bought a two and a half kilo fish and paid $40 - she was ripped off. I have paid $5 in Vietnam for a one kilo fish and had it barbecued at my table.
We then made for the harbor to eat lunch and end our trip when OH. MY.GOD. I suddenly knew how the English must have felt when they saw the Armada invading in 1588. Steaming towards us from the harbor were scores and scores and scores (I gave up counting at 125) of ships filled with people who were on day trips - it was 10 in the morning. I have never seen so many ships in my life and I have no doubt that they were all heading for the same destination. After lunch it was back in to the bus and off for the harrowing four hour trip back to Hanoi with the same driver who had driven us down.
I have given this “experience” a three button rating mainly because of the fact that there are just too many people and that didn’t jibe with my expectations. The actual services deserve a four button rating to Oriental Sails. While I paid $110 a quick survey of the other passengers determined that they had paid any where from $95 to $120. The food was adequate, they sailed me where I was supposed to be and provided fast (TOO fast) transportation to and from Halong Bay. They also provided the various elements of the tour they had promised. The “guide” was, however, not up to the job and did very little if any actual guiding. Luck of the draw I guess.

Take precautions with the jellyfish
Jul 2016 • Family
We recently finished a 3 day cruise . I am a doctor with a house in port Douglas so am well aware of stingers . We asked on the boat ( dragon legend) and looked on the website and were told there was no problem . We were swimming off the boat with everyone when my 10yo started screaming . She was covered in jellyfish stingers over 2 m long . She was wearing a one piece and rash vest but all her legs and arms were covered in stings that rapidly formed welts . We got her to the boat , the staff were hopeless doing everything wrong . Instead of carefully removing the tentacles they kept rubbing her legs with limes . I have included photos of her legs 1 hour after and a picture after 3 days . She was in excruciating pain for 4 hours and could not walk 3 days later .
The boats and tourist authorities are irresponsible and should warn people . So if you are swimming take precautions use a long sleeve rash vest and Lycra pants unless you want you holiday ruined.

The Paloma Chinese Junk Cruise on Ha Long Bay - Very Nice
Mar 2011 • Friends
We had a two day one night stay on the Chinese Junk The Paloma during our tour of Viet Nam. We really enjoyed our time on the boat, and the stunning views in Ha Long Bay.
We were picked up by a mini-bus at our Ha Noi Hotel, and were driven along with the other people on the cruise to Ha Long Bay City, the departure point for the Paloma. There were roughly 40 people on the mini-bus and we were a little cramped, its about a 3-4 hour bumpy ride to the bay from Ha Noi, so if you are claustrophobic, or don't like long rides, you may want to opt for a private car. Along the way we stopped at an embroidery factory and store, that had really nice embroidered pieces, as well as clothing, and home goods for sale. It also had a much needed bathroom, and small cafe.
Upon arriving in Ha Long Bay you board a smaller boat that brings you out to The Paloma. The Paloma is beautiful, with dark wood working and striking red accents. The rooms are good sized considering you are on a boat, and have full bathrooms in each room, as well as heat and air conditioning.
On day one the Paloma takes you out on the bay, and after a few hours cruising you get back on the smaller boat to go to the floating village that is in the bay. It is really interesting to see what life is like in the village, complete with a school, and of course a gift shop. The villagers harvest pearls for sale in the gift shop which is a good portion of their main source of income. Once in the village you can go on a bamboo boat trip around the surrounding bay area, which was very nice, or you can jump in a kayak and go for a paddle.
Back to the Paloma, and its time for a cooking lesson, we learned how to make Spring Rolls, which is not as easy as you may think.
Day two you have to option of jumping back on the small boat for a trip to the amazing cave. We did this and it is pretty cool to see, however if you would just rather relax on deck you are really not missing anything that exciting in the cave. Also there are lots of steps to get up to the cave, and lots more once you are in it, so if you have any physical limitations, this may not be for you.
Now a word about the food on the The Paloma, not only is it fantastic, its never ending!!! I think each meal was at least 4 courses, at dinner I actually lost count. The crew is also very accommodating to special diets, if you are a vegetarian, or do not eat seafood, its not a problem at all, they will make sure you are well fed either way! Most meals are some sort of seafood, with as I said several courses, and then dessert.
Breakfast has an omelet station, as well as toast and fresh fruit. Coffee was so-so, but you are on a boat!
The only unfortunate part of our trip was the weather, as it was rainy and foggy, and you really can't do much about that. Should you have bad weather the room where your meals are served has plenty of tables and great views of the bay so you can play cards, as we did, or read, or simply just relax and watch the bay go by.

Spectacular 2-Day-1-Night Halong Bay Cruise
My wife and I tried the Halong Bay Cruise just recently. I didn't know how it'd really feel like until I arrived the Ha Long Bay Wharf. The place is captivating though I was disappointed with the color of the water. It's green unlike the one I saw in websites which is blue. But well. that's advertising. We took the Houng Hai Junk Cruise. Our boat can only accommodate 13 people so the service was quite personal. Other junks can have more. I think Huong Hai Cruise is one of the biggest in terms of number of boats. Our english-speaking tour guide, Ken, is very helpful and informative. The boat staff are very courteous and at least one of them can converse in English. Food servings (Lauriat-style) are just enough to satisfy your palate. If you're into seafood, you will love the cruise. One thing I liked about our cruise was that the crew observe time to the second. Everything is up to the schedule. Cruising in Ha Long Bay isn't like any international cruise where you have to stare at the empty sea for days before you get to see something else. In Ha Long, the wharf itself is picture-perfect. We enjoy the viewing the islets (just 1% of the 3000 rock formations in Halong Bay.)
Included in the 2-day-1-night package were the following:
1. Hotel pick-up (Hanoi-Ha Long Wharf-Hanoi). Each direction will take almost 3 hour with 30-min stopover at a souvenir store.
2. Boat shuttle to and from the Junk boat.
3. 2 Lunches, 1 Dinner and One Breakfast
4. An air-conditioned cabin for two.
5. Spelunking, row boating and visit to a beach.

Must visit at least once in your lifetime
What can I say? Halong bay is simply breathtaking. Bring a digital camera otherwise you will go broke buying film! The photos & TV coverage don't do this place justice. The karsts are magnificent and the water is a gorgeous emerald green. The entrance fee to the Bay including caves etc - is a bargain at only 30,000dongs (less than US$2!). This should be included in your boat ticket.
Do yourself a favour and stay overnight on a junk boat as the best bit happens when all the daytrippers return to Halong City and the overnight boats anchor in a cove for the night. You can drink beer, gaze at stars and watch the twinkling lights from the neighbouring junks. Pretty hard to find a more romantic setting. The Hong Kong star ferry at night comes close but it only last for 8 mins! Don't waste your time staying in Halong City to save a few bucks unless you are into karaoke bars :-)
Try the Annam Junk which is owned by Halong Travel agency - it is cost about US$125/person including transport from Hanoi, meals and overnight stay in a private air-con cabin with 2 beds & ensuite. You have to pay extra for drinks. Hint - the beer from the room fridge is cheaper than from the onboard restaurant! You can also buy beer and snacks from floating "shops" - people will row their boat to sell you food.
This junk is pretty new unlike some of the other junks which look a bit creaky. We also like the staff on Annam Junk. They are pretty laid back and don't hassle you to hire kayaks or
buy stuff but these are available if you want. The food is ok and the deck has lots of lounge chairs.
If you are loaded with cash, then try the Emerauld steamer or the Dragon Pearl junk - they are more luxurious and obviously more expensive.
The only downside to Halong Bay is that it is a victim of its beauty. Super touristy - there are zillions of tourists with the same idea as you. The harbour is a bit like a market but once you get out into the bay, there is plenty of room for everyone.
Another tip - leave your main luggage in your Hanoi hotel and just bring a day pack for the junk stay.

Unfortunately, despite its UNESCO heritage listing, this area is putrid.
Despite the fact we visited in “low season”, it was literally teeming with humanity. Every beach and walk we visited was shoulder to shoulder. The water was littered with every form of rubbish. I could count at least 50 boats at any one time, often substantially more.
Definitely not recommended.

Violet Junk Luxury Cruise Collection
Jun 2011 • Couples
We chose the two night cruise option and are very glad we did. We arrived in Hanoi and decided to go straight from the airport to Ha Long Bay, spend the night at the Novotel and join the cruise the following day. This made for a relaxing start to our trip after our 3.5 hour drive.
While waiting to join the Violet you could sit in a coffee shop withe free WiFi. This is when they take your luggage to the junk and have it waiting for your arrival. We then joined the other guests on the tender taking us out to the Violet Junk. We took a seat in the dining room and were given our room keys, a welcome drink and our iteneray. Our suite was the Dragon on the forward port top deck. This junk has only 6 cabins making it an intimate cruise.
We really liked our suite and found it very lovely as long as you did not look to close at the finish. The suite was large with a chaise lounge, desk with mini bar, in room safe (not bolted down though), spa bath and separate shower. I have to say it was one of the best views from a bathtub we have had in our travels. The decorations were indochine charm. We had no problem with hot water and had plenty of it. You could open your curtains and take in the view from bed or better yet sit on your private balcony and have the ultimate 5 star view.
The meals were quite good. We had lunch on the cruise out to our first stop of the day at a local fishing village. After our on the water tour we rejoined the Violet for cocktails and free time until dinner. You were given a few options for each course and I had the small lobster which was actually very good. During this time you could have cocktails on the top deck or get a massage. My husband and I both had a massage. It was okay, not the best, not the worst.
Next morning was an early start where you join the day boat. This is a small, newly built junk you spend the day on while the Violet goes back to port to drop off the one night guests and pick up the next lot. Once on board the Sunset we had a cooked breakfast and given a run through of the days events. We were first off to Cat Ba island for a bike ride to a village that had been there for 300 years. What good fun and really interesting. The best part of our cruise so far. Afterwards it was back for lunch and then kayaking with a crew member from the day junk. This is where you could go swimming. I will get back to this a bit later in the review. The boat is very nice, but could use a bit more shade on the top deck. Because in June the afternoon sun is very hot and very strong. There were plenty of deck chairs. But is was so hot we chose to stay inside and take advantage of the A/C.
Later in the afternoon we rejoined the Violet for before dinner cocktails. Next day was another early start for a walk up the hundred steps for a view of the bay. It is really 100 steps plus a bit of a hilly climb. So take some water with you. This is in an area they have prepared for the tourists with a pavilion, changing rooms, drinks for sale and a clean swimming area. You will also want to have a swim, as the climb is a bit steep and sweaty during the summer.
We were really happy we stayed for two nights and the time flys by and one night just does not do this area justice.
All the crew did their very best to give us good service. Yes, it could be better, but in MHO this is throughout the entire hospitality industry of Vietnam. They are on a learning curve and will only get better. The Violet is a lovely junk, the dining room on on the main deck and small sitting area on the upper deck and a beautiful area on the top deck with lounge chairs, a bar and sitting areas. Yes, the wine is expensive, we just ordered the cheaper stuff with dinner and took our own to enjoy in our cabin.
