Response from Furama Villas Manager, Guest Services / Front Office at Furama Villas Danang
Responded 1 week ago
Dear guest, We hear you and will follow up on the matter. In the meantime we will ask Tripadvisor to remove your review as you are clearly breaking the rules of this portal. You are supposed to use social media responsibly and to give the management a fair chance to settle matters before posting. Posting a complaint without even asking for the management is in my understanding a basic rule of courtesy. I am looking forward meeting you personally The General Manager

TERRIBLE SERVICE !!!!
We checked in last night in villa....noone was there for welcome & we had to wait long at the reception for lack of buggey & lack of staff...!! Had to wait for luggage for check in for lack of staff... !! Noone to keep luggage in rooms for lack of staff... !!! We requested the buggey guy to keep the luggage but he said he is very busy because no staff !!!!! WHY IS THE PROPERTY CHARGING EXHORBITANTLY WHEN THEY HAVE NO STAFF & NO ONE ATTERR RECEPTION ??? Not worth a 5 Star property AT ALL ðŸ‘Ž Won't recommend the property to ANYONE visiting Da Nang from INDIA !!

Dear guest Thank you for your feedback. I will personally look into the matter. In the meantime I have to say that I am shocked about the rude language you are using on a public visible social media. I also do not understand why you give for all our services including the property, the food and everything else a 1* star rating. All we do must be terrible as per your post. To be clear, I strongly believe into the right for the guest to highlight our shortcomings. At the same time I believe a guest shall remain polite and give a balance feedback. A 3* rating mentioning the good and the bad would be appropriate in my opinion. Furthermore, you are still in house â€“ please feel free to personally meet me / ask for me. Just lacking out frustrations in rudeness and without talking is not what our guest usually do. The General Manager
