Wonderful
The room was amazing, extremely comfortable beds with a breathtaking view. The staff are very accommodating and always willing to help with anything you need. There are few dishes in the kitchen, but the amount of great restaurants in the area more than make up for it.

Highly Reccommend
Great, everythin' was amazing. I went in rainy days but it's still ok cuz sometimes sunny came. I was supported a lot by staff in the hotel. A staff Lien or lin (I don't remember exactly) helped me find my lost item. Thank you. Once again I would come back there when I have a chance to get Viet Nam.

10 out of 10 stars I would recommend this property.
The hotel was beautiful quite appropriate The staff is very friendly, attentive. The ladies at the front desk Thuong and Loc were the best staff I have ever had in a hotel. The spa facilities and rooftop pool and bar put a crowning touch to my stay.

The wonderful experience at A La Carte.
The recent wonderful vacation at A La Carte Hotel was not just a simple journey but also an incredible experience that awakened all my senses. From the moment I stepped foot into the hotel to the enthusiastic reception, everything here radiated elegance and meticulous care. The attentive service from the staff was not only a job but also a genuine expression of sincerity and readiness to assist. Every request from my family was promptly and professionally fulfilled, creating a tranquil and secure space. Looking back on the vacation, I not only hold onto beautiful images of A La Carte Hotel but also the most wonderful emotions from the time spent with my family.
