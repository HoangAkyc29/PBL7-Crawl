Comfort food for the soul
Researched online about some of the local places to go in Da Nang, and this seem to be the place to go for bun cha ca. Came here in the morning for breakfast and had a bowl of piping hot fish cake noodle soup. And wow this really hit the spot! The soup was a perfect broth while the fish cakes were crunchy and full of flavour... One piece even had black pepper bits in it.Even with all the good food in Vietnam I dare say this is one of the more memorable places to eat at. Another plus point: Only vnd 25,000 a bowl!!

Local noodles, done right
25,000 VND for a bowl of rice noodles with fish cake, served with all the condiments you can imagine. Take a seat and simply indicate how many servings you would like. One of the best, simplest meals I've had in this part of Vietnam, without any awkward service, up sell or special foreigner prices.

Very cheap local food with great flavour
They only serve one dish here which is fish cake noodle soup. You have to try it if you are close by. It's so cheap that you can go for seconds and you wouldn't notice it on your bill. Eat where the locals eat and you know it's a good place

Overrated Noodle Soup
Bun Cha Ca is one of the many variations of noodle dishes that you can get in Vietnam and this one is unique in having deep-fried fishcakes served with the fine vermicelli noodle soup.
We found this particular shop from food reviews but also found it to be overrated as I would give it at best an average rating only, based on taste. Through our walkabouts in the city, I’m sure there are many other restaurants or roadside stalls that might be selling better Bun Cha Ca noodles but have not been reviewed.

Da Nang's best local food.
Just 30,000 vnd (the price in July 2015) for a special bowl of 'Bun cha ca', which was full of 'cha ca' (fish pie), that was one of the best meals in my life, the soup was excellent.

lunch for 1
Following TA reviews I trotted around the block from my hotel to have some lunch.
Yes there is only one dish on order but it's exactly what I'd been reading about for the last 6 months.
A fantastic feed it was and I left as content as I've ever been for ages, just enough heat in the dish for tingly lips accompanied by an balanced explosion of spice & zing. Phew!

Great lunch
Only one choice on the menu, but wow they do it well. Eat with some locals, nice staff, who cannot speak English but it isn't a problem. Lunch for 2 was about $3 usd. Worth the visit.

The local noodle
Yes this is very local.
Not the general stop for the average tourist and only discovered through the Funtastic Da nang food tour.
The decor is as other reviewers have stated the plastic chair and low tables.
Don't be put off on appearances the noodles are just great and overall very tasy.
The price is just so low.
Any one on a budget will love this but for the more well heeled make the break and try this just for the experience.

Great local food!
My sister and I were hankering for some real local food and this hit the spot! Don't expect anything fancy - plastic tables and chairs - but the bun cha ca was great!

Good Local Restaurant
This restaurant is full of local Da Nang people because of its price and delicious taste. I heard this restaurant has a long history in Da Nang. I liked Bun Cha Ca here so after finish breakfast, I bought some Cha Ca ( Fish pie) take away for lunch. I remembered the price was about 90 000VND for 0.5 kg of Fish pie. It is easy to find this restaurant because it stays in the center of Da Nang. You should try if you like Da Nang food
