해변 바로 앞이라서 해수욕 즐기고 싶으신 분들께 추천 해 드려요. Hotel is front of sea 🌊🏊🏻‍♀️ 시내는 다리 하나 건너면 바로입니다. 하지만 그만큼 시내가 아니라서 가까이 카페 등은 적습니다. 수영장은 생각보다 작아요. Swimming pool is not big but.. 직원들이 매우 친절 합니다 !!!Staff very very kind !! Good !! 정말 친절 하나는 최고.! 👍🏻👍🏻😀

Better than expected!
We stayed with 3 small children under the age of 5 and were hoping to have enough space for everyone to relax. The room was very nice and had plenty of space for everyone to stretch out and still leave open areas after kids went to sleep. The staff was always very friendly and worked with us to make sure we had everything we wanted and needed. The restaurant had great food and lots of western options which was a surprise to my family after many travels throughout Asia. The pool and rooftop bar were very nice, as was the spa. The kids areas were very nice as well, we didn’t know what to expect honestly, they were small but the children loved them, good for kids below about 7 yrs old. Wish we could’ve stayed longer!
Dear teamhrupek2009, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience and post such a wonderful review. We truly appreciate your positive comments and compliments about our staff, the room, the beach and the food. We are glad that you had enjoyed your stay with us. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon. Kind regards, À La Carte Team.

Great view but noisy
The hotel is well situated opposite the beach. The hotel room was spacious and clean. We did not use the kitchen facilities. The restaurant staff did not understand what vegetarian meant though. The staff were friendly enough but seeing that it is a big hotel, you do not get that boutique hotel treatment. It is quite a busy hotel with people milling around the lobby at all times. In regards to the noise: We had a sea facing room, so the construction next door was not that noisy. There is however a beach concert held opposite the hotel. Of course this is not at the control of the hotel. The music does go on until late into the night. But if you are looking for some RnR like the American troops did at My Khe beach in the 70’s then this is not the place. Rather book at one of the…

Good view and young design
We came to A La Carte for one night to enjoy Danang international firework. Our room view was so nice, we could see clearly the firework show. I love design with fresh blue color of the hotel. The breakfast buffet was good. Receptionist staffs were really friendly.

Chinese is everywhere
Like what stated in title, you will see Chinese people every corner in the hotel, especially at the lobby. They are just so noisy. Location: 10/10 (opposite to the sea) Environment: 3/10 (so noisy, just so noisy, kids running outside and you hear their footsteps like King Kong) Service: 8/10 (I will give them 10/10 if they can control the kids and even the customers) Food: 8/10 (room service with good western food at reasonable prices)

Comfortable and Convenient!
Stayed for a week with my girlfriend whilst visiting Da Nang and surrounding areas. The rooms are very spacious and comfortable, with great facilities and cleaning service. The staff were very helpful answering queries and providing a shuttle bus service to Hoi An, Ba Na Hills and the airport. The hotel is close to the beach, and there is a lovely view of it from the top (though currently there is a construction site on one side is slightly obstructive). The roof top pool and bar are a bonus for the view - especially at night! Hope to return again in the future.
