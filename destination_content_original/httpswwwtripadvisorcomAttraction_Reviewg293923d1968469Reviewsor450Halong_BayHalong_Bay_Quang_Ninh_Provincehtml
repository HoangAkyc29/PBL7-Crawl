Howard‚Äôs visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Terrible Experience
Feb 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples
So upset! Had the worst time! Be very very careful when you book this. We paid for 3 days, 2 nights. Told you get a welcome drink, arrive and spend one night at the hotel on Cat Ba Island and one night on the boat. Arrive and got no welcome drink (not a biggy) had to buy own drinks. Went to Cat Ba Island with a few others who booked the same package. No communication about anything. Got taken to nature park in morning. Man pointed to hill to climb then were on our own. Got picked up late and dropped back at hotel - had to find own way to beach (no communication or signs). Back to boat in afternoon - INFESTED with cockroaches. They were in our bags, on our bed. Tiny babies crawling on us so had to sleep at the table and not our room. Told the man and listened then walked away. NO SLEEP at all. Just moored and didnt go anywhere then back to Hanoi in the morning. Didn't see ANYTHING that was advertised in the book (shown all these islands we go to - one by China). Can't get a refund for such poor service but can recommend none of you do this package. WASTE of MONEY and very upsetting start to our Vietnam trip!! 100Nz dollars down the drain and the most expensive part of our whole 2month trip.

ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER
Oct 2016
Halong Bay was something I built a lot of excitement over. However, the postcard perfect pictures should be retaken with the smog, vessel fumes & thin layer of oily pollution on the water.

It was so sad to see. The ocean has no sparkle left. There was 'western' rubbish floating in the water & it was packed to the gunnels with junk boats & shuttles all spewing grey diesel fumes.
The solitary fishing village is struggling to survive & there is very little bird life.
Swimming in the bay, we could taste the pollution on our lips & feel it on our skin.
For thousands of years Halong Bay was home to 3500 fishing families who were asked to leave & displaced in order to make way for tourism. Uneducated, many of them could not find jobs in the city. It ruined an ancient way of life... And ruined this natural wonder.
The limestone outcrops were still beautiful. But I left feeling sad. It's. 'world heritage listing' is an absolute farce.... as it won't be 'inherited' by anyone. It's ecosystem & majesty will be dead for future generations without dramatic/harsh change that sacrifices much of the tourists $

Beautiful place but rubbish everywhere
Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples
I didn't go in the water as you can see there's garbage floating pretty much everywhere. I didn't wanted to stay in the boat for 3 days so what we did is to check at cat ba island and did a full day tour instead. The cost is almost the same if you take the 3 days tour but I just didn't wanted to not have option about the food and I easily get motion sickness also so staying at cat ba was much better for me. We toured at Lan ha bay and monkey island and some kayaking. For the kayaking be careful, make sure your kayak is good. We passed by some guys and their kayak was broken so they had to swim back to our boat.

Beautiful but dirty. Don't swim!
Sep 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family
Just visited the bay on the Dragon Pearly (which was really good). Felt compelled to write about our experience. The bay and port look terrible. You instantly question the sustainability of the bay with so many tourists AND tankers around. I have also, while travelling inVietnam, been reading "Vietnam, Rising Dragon" by Bill Haystock. This prompted me to think about the health of the Bay, as the government is highly unlikely to make the environment a high priority over growth and employment. After more research I discovered in 2015 there were devastating floods in the area which caused the "local" coal mine to flood and the toxic wastes were sent flowing into the bay. There are lots of comments about sewage issues but I think his is the least of the concerns. The coal mine toxins are shocking poisons. My daughter swam in the Bay as the tour company didn't say there were any issues with water safety. It has only occurred to me now that my daughter smelled really bad later that evening. I now realise it was the water. Do not swim in the Bay. It still looks beautiful and once your away from the crowds it is very peaceful. But the government needs to implement some strategies urgently before it is lost forever.

Cruising through fields of garbage and waste
The Ha Long bay starts to have a serious pollution problem. We were cruising, swimming and kayaking through large amounts of floating cans, plastic bags, foam, and other garbage. Get his environment cleaning program working otherwise this area will go towards a sad ending....

The Pollution of Halong Bay
Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples
We were really looking forward to our two night cruise on Halong Bay and it did not disappoint. What was sooo disappointing and disgusting to see was the pollution. Debris floating everywhere in the water and each day hundreds of tourist boats releasing their raw sewerage into the Bay. The boat we were on was only four years old and it too dumped its waste into the Bay. Something needs to be done to improve this situation.

Breathtaking seascape with thousands of islets

This season seems to have a few foreigners but I found many Vietnamese people go on holiday here. I spent daytime on a cruise before reaching Cat Ba island. The best way to explore your own pace at the Bay is to do Kayak. A must-visit when traveling the Northern Vietnam

Stunning views but slightly ruined by horrendous customer service
Jun 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples
The views are amazing don't get me wrong. Look at any photo and you'll see it is a beautiful place with stunning sights.
My negatives with this are very long though:
- Did not get the boat and package that I paid for
- Booked for 2 nights on 1 boat ended up switching to 3 boats over 2 days (not told about this)
- Horribly overpriced drinks
- Adamant guides on doing all the planned activities, even if you already said you didn't want to, or that you had done them already
- Lots of waiting around, doing nothing whilst waiting for boat transfers or other guests
- Incredibly busy, lucky to get a photo without another boat in it
- Staff and guides on all boats not very helpful with the problems nor did they care.
Those were some of the negatives bullet pointed, didn't want to spend too much time talking about it because pretty much every other person we met on this trip had the same stuff happen to them.
Customers just treated like cattle.
We came, we saw the bay, won't be back again.
