Amazing environment, service and food quality.
Toanle offered super great service and advice for our lunch meal and cocktails at Citron restaurant, intercontinental resort Da Nang. His cocktail, Monkey Tail is a bit strong with special favor made from Vietnamese rum. The restaurant environment is amazing and we enjoyed our first day lunch here. Great !!!

Matchless wonderful hotel with top service quality and architecture.
An eye-opening magical hotel where one meets the top quality hotel/room design. From Heaven level to Sky, Earth, and Sea; although expensive, the quality one experiences here worth the money spent. Every staff is kind and professional in offering their services and care. Love their L_O_N_G Bar where I can actually be relaxed and space-out, it's a must-visit! Need to mention their top-class kids club as well, my son loooooves staying there. Afternoon tea at Citron is abundant and tasty, love the scones and side mascarpone and jams! Definitely a place where I'd love to re-visit.
Dear h0chinl, We're delighted to hear that you enjoyed your recent stay at our resort, and we thank you for your kind comments.

The wonderful memories
I highly recommend everyone to have a stay in such a wonderful place! Nice ocean view. "Friendly" monkeys. Warm welcome by every staffs in the resort. Quick reaction from every department. REALLY enjoyed my holiday here. The stays far exceeded my expectations. Besides, i really want to give special thanks to two gentleman: Quoc (Resort Assistant Manager) Mr Hung (Receptionist) Here is the story: By the first day of my trip, only my wife, kid and me could arrive at hotel but other family members could not arrive due to visa validation date issue at first day of lunar new year.

住了五晚全球最美洲际，真有传说中那么好？
岘港太阳半岛洲际度假酒店向来被誉为洲际品牌在亚洲地区的旗舰分号， 洲际很多宣传广告上都能看到它的身影， 由此可见该酒店在洲际品牌里的地位。 岘港洲际是Bill Bensley耗时六年打造的度假村， 这也是我个人打卡的第5家Bill设计的酒店， 设计上吸收了越南当地建筑特色， 黑白相间的颜色， 分别代表越南寺庙中的黑漆木与白砖， 太熟悉不过的风格。 岘港洲际是可以“躺着”办理入住的。 下车后， 穿过中间的水池， 就是一片开阔地面向大海的露台， 两旁各有一个大床， 迎客饮品是冰镇的洛神花水， 躺在床上把护照交给前台即可。 酒店依山而建， 大堂是整个度假村地势最高的位置， 客房依次而下， 分别以Heaven、Sky、Earth和Sea命名， 越靠近海房费越贵。 垂直纵深方向， 有一个船形缆车Nam Tram往返于酒店的各个区域。 此次入住的是Heaven层一间视野非常一般的套房， 而且是在投诉了前台接待态度糟糕以后， 宾客关系不情不愿给到的升级。 客房面积很一般， 没有比乞丐房大太多， 阳台占了很大面积。 这里的猴子大多不太怕人， 甚至会跳上客房阳台， 所以酒店工作人员也会再三叮嘱离开客房时务必要锁阳台门， 仅仅是关门的话猴子依旧能进房间。 酒店也将猴子奉为吉祥物， 处处可见猴子元素。 相比较下来卫生间倒是挺大， Bill Bensley还有个人特点就是不做淋浴区的隔断， 每次淋浴总会让人担心水溅出去弄湿地巾， 备品则是45ml的帕尔玛之水。 酒店内提供许多活动项目， 项目列表展示于大堂中， 提前预约即可。 我最推荐的一项是Nature Tour， 是跟随向导坐车前往酒店外寻找猴子。 在海边也有众多水上体验项目， 其中最有特色的莫过于越南传统的簸箕船。 去年酒店对大部分区域都做了翻新， 最主要的变化便是揭幕了全新的行政酒廊。…

The best resort in Da Nang
Beautiful resort and lovely staffs. Restaurant attendants were warm and kind (they are amazing with taking photos too so don’t hesitate to ask ^^). Met a cute staff named Suong at Citron, looked after us with great hospitality. Worth every minute of stay!

Lovely Easter family holiday at this resort
Took the family here for Easter. Great weather for that time of year. Loved the property with the tram service that scales the hill to take you from the villas and rooms to the beach. The buggy service was also excellent. Spent most of our time on the beach and in the pool. The room was spacious and well designed. Also had a monkey visit on our balcony which was equal parts amusing and fascinating! Had a grown-ups only dinner at La Maison 1888 which was exquisite. The head sommelier, Jimmy was a standout with his spot-on pairings and down to earth personality. Used the in-room babysitting and felt at ease with the kind and attentive staff. Also then hotel manager, Seif was such lovely and friendly character who took care of ours and our children’s needs. Would highly recommend…

值得入住的洲際酒店
This is my first time staying at the InterContinental Hotels. It is very comfortable here and the sea water is very clean and clear! There are many activities to participate in. SON DINH took us to experience boating. The people are very kind and enthusiastic! Will take the initiative to take photos for us and pay attention to our needs. I like it very much, the scenery is beautiful and the service is very good ~ I stayed here for two days and everything was perfect 😍

Toanle is very cool. He is so kind and has good manners. Moreover, he is good at taking pictures and we are facinated about all things from him. And I think this place is best resort in the world and we have great memories. Thank you for all.

Exceptionally kind assistance in emergency
We stayed there for New Year holidays and were deeply touched by kindness from the hotel at our unexpected change in schedule. Our plan was to indulge in this special resort for a couple of days, but we found out that we would need to check out the next day due to an emergency at home soon after we had checked in. Ms. Hong Le, who assisted us during check-in and consequently early check-out, showed us extraordinary compassion about us by offering that the hotel would cover incidental charges such as restaurants meals since the accommodation would be nonrefundable. Because her generous offer sounded beyond our imagination, we first thought we mistook her since English is not our mother tongue. Ms. Le, then brought a Japanese speaking staff, Ms. Ngan to explain and help ensure…

Fantastic in every way
Awesome views, insta-worthy lobby, good food, great gym, nice beach, comfortable room, great service from all the staff. Very well managed resort. They even have a Planet Trekkers for kids, with a kids WC area, that is going the extra mile. One of the best hotels i had stayed in.
