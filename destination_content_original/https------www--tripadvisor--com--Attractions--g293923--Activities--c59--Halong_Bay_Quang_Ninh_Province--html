This is how transportation companies should do it
I was concerned we wouldn't find transport FROM Halong Bay to Hanoi rather than vice versa, but Halong Transportation was there for us. Great communication - I heard from them several days before our trip to confirm, which was comforting because I had a contact point. They sent photos of the vehicle and license plate information so it was easier to find the driver at the pickup point. The driver on the return trip even did a couple block detour for us so we could see one more sight before we left Hanoi.

Great service!
Booked a drive from Halong Bay to Cat Bi airport. The driver came on time, it was a smooth and quiet ride. There was WiFi in the car and the driver gave us water bottle. And to top it off the price was half the price our hotel asked for.

Amazing experience! Wished we stayed longer
We had an amazing time. The staff were so lovely and helpful. Especially Linh Chi, she was very attentive in serving us and taking great group photos - we really appreciate it. Bruce Panda was very informative on our small boat rides to the cruise and activities.

Ha Long Bay Disgrace
The Orchid Cruises ship itself was very nice. We had a great, well appointed room, that was very clean and provided great views. The food and activities on board were very good. We were, however, dissatisfied with a couple of things. My wife didn't care to go to the cave tour, which turned out to be a good thing. There was no explanation in advance about the physical fitness that would be required to complete the tour, which was above average, to negotiate excessive stairs often without railings (146 very steep stairs at the very start) both to reach the opening and exit it at the end. My wife could not have completed it and would have been embarrassed. The second disappointment was the bay itself, at least the part where our ship and literally 25 other large vessels anchored. It was like being enclosed in a village of tall buildings that virtually obscured enjoying the scenery of the Bay, which is the total point of going. Even more distasteful was the floating garbage that was everywhere, often forming large islands of plastic and styrofoam, with individual pieces as large as car doors, floating on water polluted with oil streaks. A fellow passenger who went kayaking in the morning, reported that the crew required that he be hosed off before leaving the deck. This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site!! The Vietnam Government's allowance of this natural gem to be overused (I was told there are up to 500 ships licensed to carry thousand of passengers a day to the Bay) and failure to protect it from rampant pollution, is a disgrace.

I have wanted to visit Ha Long Bay for years. I will never return nor recommend it to others, while it remains in this sad condition.

Paradise on La Casta Cruise
We were incredibly lucky to have the VIP suite on our trip. Our room included a whirlpool bath and our very own sauna.
The food was divine. Especially the evening meal, which was enjoyed with some wonderful cocktails.
We used our time to thoroughly relax on board, but others did go on the canoes and reported to have enjoyed their experience.

Lovely Experience.
You‚Äôll need lots of storage for your photos, the scenery is quite spectacular.
The cruise staff and accommodation were outstanding, extremely friendly. The cabins are fabulous with little balconies.
The selection of food was also delicious. Drinks were charged separately and as you‚Äôd expect from any cruise were rather expensive.
I would recommend the 2 night cruise as on the 1 night cruise you do not board until the afternoon and then dock again the next morning.

Exotic cruise and a beautiful place to stay. Hallong Bay is itself a beautiful place with rich natural beauty. Cruise had made the trip even more exotic and luxurious.
Thanks to Travellia from CCU India, for arranging the same.
We stayed only for 1 night but atleast a 2night stay was required.
Food displayed was super tasty. Drinks served were also excellent.
