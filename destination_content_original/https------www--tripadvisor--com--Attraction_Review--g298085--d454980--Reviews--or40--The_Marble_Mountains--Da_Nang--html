About
Discover the tunnels and grottoes within Thuy Son, the only one of the five Marble Mountains that’s open to travelers. Marvel at the Buddhist temples carved into the rock, then head to the hilltop overlook for awe-inspiring views of the city. Join a guided tour to learn more about the history of the mountains. To reach the summit, take the elevator or climb the stairs; if you choose to do the latter, be very careful as the marble steps tend to be slippery. Visit early in the morning or later in the day to escape the midday heat and beat the crowds. – Tripadvisor

Beautiful!
Everything is great here. I docked 1 point off the rating only because I think visitors should just prepare for being followed and asked to buy things. The people are friendly and kind but do follow you around if you speak English. It doesn’t overly bother me but I can see it being overwhelming for some. Wear non slip shoes as the steps are obviously very old and crumbling so you want non stick. The elevator up is very hot but only takes about 30 seconds to get up or down. There’s lots of places to buy water and souvenirs. You have to buy a ticket for entrance as well as a ticket to use the elevator up. There are steps to climb up however it can be challenging for anyone who isn’t sure footed. You can always take the elevator down. Ticket in per person is 40,000 dong and elevator is 15,000 dong up and buy another ticket to go down (total 30,000).

An unreal and divine experience
An experience that can't be put into words. 1. It's easy to reach from Da Nang about 15 mins scooty ride 2. The way up is via elevator as well through a cheap ticket 3. There are multiple caves but the one to not miss out on is the HUYEN KHONG cave. Feels absolutely unreal and there is an air which will just leave you at a standstill.

More like a theme park than a cultural attraction
I’m not sure I would recommend this place. Yes, the temples and caves are very cool. But it is crazy crowded, the signage is not great (the map we were given was sort of helpful but we still got lost more than once), and all the neon lights and souvenir stands make it feel more like a theme park than a cultural attraction. If you are staying in Da Nang or Hoi An and don’t have much time to sightsee and don’t mind the theme park atmosphere then you might have a good time, otherwise I’d recommend going to Hue or going to temples that are less commercialized.

Great experience even with a toddler.
A great experience with our 2.5yr old! Don't bring a pram though. And be prepared to carry your kid up and down a lot of stairs. But our kid enjoyed the experience and so did we. We didn't take the elevator, and the inital staircase was do-able. The stairs to the peak are what was challenging because it was steep!

Nice tourist trap
Not for everyone as some steps and caves are rocky steps of marble polished over time. At least one cave, most people chose not to go deeper because the steps are a little challenging.There was a lot of trash and junk,..even in a country known for it one would think more pride would be taken at an attraction like this, making it less beautiful. Overall, it was Ok for money, but note the large hell cave is separate admission. The area at the entrance has a tourist trap vibe and vendors will charge 5x more...they work it well and we're fun, to talk to so yes, we knowingly overpaid.,. For a souvenir with a story.

Sweaty awesome mess
Amazing adventure. The caves, lookout points, and atmosphere are not to be missed. You will sweat more than you ever have in your life. The stairs are tough to navigate - slick and uneven. Bring plenty of water and go early to beat the crowds.

Average and busy
This was our second trip here and we didn't enjoy it as much as the first time. The caves are cool to walk into and a nice respite from the heat but I wasn't a big fan of the windy small stairs to climb up and down especially as they are two way. It does feel like a little bit of a rip off getting charged for every bit separately, the cave, the Pagoda, the lift both ways, would prefer to pay one ticket price which covers you for everything. There are a few vendors to get drinks and ice cream along the way which was welcome in the heat. There was building work going on so it was quie noisy on the lower levels and you did get dust over you when you walked past to the high levels, feel like they could have put up on a dust sheet

A must see
This was an unexpected pleasant surprise. What they have done inside the mountains is amazing to see. The little stalls outside have some lovely gifts also. Must try the fresh coconuts, very refreshing. Make sure you waer comfortable shoes as the floor inside the cave can be slippy

Great experience
Jan 2023 • Friends
It is about 15-20 minutes from Da Nang's center. We paid 20,000 dong each for the first cave near the Marble Mountain's entrance and 40,000 dong per person to go to the top plus 15,000 dong for each tide for the elevator. We climbed the highest peak and went to see the other caves. There's a lot to see, so you could spend the entire day exploring the area.

Nice but not worth the cost of a tour
Feb 2023 • Solo
Nice way to spend an afternoon in DA Nang - you can walk up one of the mountains. There are caves, pagodas and viewpoints. It’s not worth the cost of a guided tour - take the local bus (or hire a motorbike if you’re feeling confident then you also have the freedom to go elsewhere when you wish - the roads in da nang are a bit better than some other cities with one way streets and traffic lights but still very busy) 55 vnd entry including the lift up but not down. Lots of shops at the bottom wanting to sell you things.

Hidden gem
Jan 2020 • Family
This is an amazing area to explore. From the outside it’s hard to imagine all the intricate caves and sights inside. If you are fit and enable there are many caves and areas to explore here. No need to go up and down the lift.

It costs about 50,000 VND by grab from Da Nang (10 mins)

A mountain of Marble
Jan 2020 • Friends
The sprawling complex can be accessed by steep stairs or the elevator. We we asked to carry a pot plant of New Year/Tet flowers to the first temple. The cave complexes are fascinating. Not a rainy day activity.

Great place - opportunity lost
Dec 2022 • Family
This place was well worth a visit. We went with a local guide and it was worth it because he showed us a lot that standard tours don’t see. The temples are beautiful and the caves truely amazing!
It’s a strenuous walk to the top but if you have good fitness you’ll be fine, the view of the area is nice. There is an elevator to part of the mountain.
What we could not cope with was that rubbish is left on the tracks. Surely for a tourist destination that charges an entry fee someone could send some blokes in with a rubbish bag to clear up the plastic bottles, wrappers, and everything else, that are all over the place and put some signs up that litterers will be prosecuted. It’s really not cool.
Everyone - tourists included- need to do better when it comes to rubbish. Vietnam can’t afford to lose tourists! It seems people turn a blind eye but it is absolutely putting me off this part of the world. Ban the plastics.

Worth the visit but be prepared to climb
Sep 2022 • Family
Beautiful pagodas and Buddha statues set among mountain forest and caves. We really enjoyed the couple of hours we spent exploring here. We took the elevator up and walked back down where there were cafes for us to grab fresh cold drinks.
Worth the visit but you’ll need to be fit and be wearing sneakers because there’s A LOT of stairs and parts that are tricky to navigate (steep climbs, narrow footholds).
It was rainy season when we visited - cloudy and 30C degrees. I couldn’t imagine doing this in the heat of Vietnamese summer!
Also, be prepared for the hard sell on marble statues and ornaments- the streets at the foot of the mountains are lined with stores selling these.

Worth every step!
Jan 2023 • Couples
Marble mountains is a fantastic area to explore Asian religion and hike at the same time.It involves strenuous climbs up many stairs, especially to see the different vantage points, but it’s worth every step! The main cave with a Buddha statue and sunlight shining in from about 30 m high opening in the ceiling will remain with you far longer than you think. Highly recommend!

Enjoyed the caves & great short 2-3 hour day trip from Danang , especially if then going to Hoi An.
Feb 2024 • Couples
Easy 2-3 hour excursion from Danang.
Can do it yourself by booking a Grab so no need for an organised package.
It’s enroute from Danang to Hoi An , so would recommend Marble Mountains & then head to Hoi A for the evening lanterns on the river.
Marble Mountains has some nice caves , pagodas & small temples. Best bits are the caves.
Avoid the elevator , long queue for it & only takes you up a small section which we walked in 10 mins.
Some of the steps on Marble Mountain higher up are quite steep but doable.
