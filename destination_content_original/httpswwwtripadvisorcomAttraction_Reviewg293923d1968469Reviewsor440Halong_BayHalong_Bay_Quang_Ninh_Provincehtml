Howard‚Äôs visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Other wordly
Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

Highly recommend
I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Stay overnight here and not a day trip from Hanoi
Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends
While there are many day trips to Halong from Hanoi, I recommend staying overnight here. It is a long road journey from Hanoi and I recommend arriving here in the evening and either taking an overnight cruise or staying in one of the many reasonably priced hotels near the shore. The morning boat cruise is very good since it is cooler and you get back in time for lunch and can then drive back to Hanoi. The bay is spectacular with many beautiful islands and rock formations. There are several rock islands that have interesting names and it is a wonderful way to spend a few hours relaxing in a boat - must see on anyone's trip to Vietnam!!

Amazing Cruise in a Breathtaking Location
Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family
We were welcomed aboard the Junk ship by the friendly, helpful and attentive crew and served with a welcome lunch of Vietnamese delicacies all prepared and beautifully presented by their young aspiring Chef. We were then taken to a cave in which there were stalagmites and stalagtites. Towels, footware and polyethelene rain macks were provided. We were then taken kayaking then back to the Junk Ship for an evening of yet more culinary delights, a short film of the cruise, fishing and star gazing.

Unfortunately negative
Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples
I reluctantly write my first negative review. Ha Long Bay is a reminder of the devastating effects humanity has on the environment. After visiting a crowded cave with litter and construction we cruised through plastic filled water. We were let off to kayak through depressing waters with dead coral, plastic and styrofoam with a pearl farm nearby. I would highly recommend skipping Ha Long Bay and go to Cat Ba instead. It was more remote, cleaner, and more mellow. Don't get me wrong, this are as a whole can be beautiful and special but the specific Ha Long Bay Area, where the cruise ships anchor, leaves you to wonder what good the UNESCO certification does.

If you go to Vietnam a cruise around Halong Bay is a must. We spent 2 nights on the beautiful and traditional junk "Jasmine". The service, food and attention to detail was 5*+. The scenery was sublime!

Stunning
Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples
I have done a separate review of Dragon Legend 2 who we did our 2 day one night trip with, which was booked through BestPrice.vn. Ha Long bay is stunning, the reason we booked Dragon Legend 2 is all other boats follow each other on a specied route so you can get 10 or twenty boats in view at any one time. DL2 goes on a completely different route no other boats come this way so you always have peace and tranquility to enjoy the stunning scenery. The DL2 also is only boat (I think) with swimming pool on board. The scenery during the daytime and sunrise and sunset is truly stunning and you get very close to the rock formations. The sea is very calm and is almost like a duck pond. A must see if in Hanoi.

Very disappointed in the amount of rubbish in the water
May 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends
We were last in Halong Bay about 9 years ago and it was a lot cleaner back then. This time we went kayaking and swimming and it was like swimming in soup - condoms, plastic packaging etc. Just disgusting! I really hope the Vietnamese government does something to clean the Bay up as otherwise they can expect to see a downturn in tourists. For this reason I won't be back.

Similar visually to Tam Coc and Bai Tu Long
Stayed overnight on a boat but a day tour would be more than enough as the overnight boats only offer 12 hours on the water, 7 of which you are asleep!

Bai Tu long bay is part of the same area just with a different name and no overnight boats. Head there for a quieter more authentic sail. You won't be missing out on not visiting ha long bay because it is just another name for the same area!
Thoroughly recommend visiting Trang An near Ninh Binh to see karst from a more intimate characterful setting.

Great Scenery but avoid GOLDEN BAY CRUISE!!
Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends
Ha long bay it self was beautiful. Great scenery and enjoyed the tour to Surprise cave, and beach, although over crowded. We mistakenly booked through another operator, rather than the one we were recommended (FANTASEA Tours) and chose to do a one night tour.
Our accommodation was good, complete with ensuite with hot water, and good pressure.
Lunch was good on the first day, whole fish, pickled vege, rice, tofu and cabbage. This unfortunately was my favourite meal. 500ml bottles of water were US$1 a bottle (24VND) which was normally 7VND, we were told nothing that was purchased from the ship could be consumed on the ship. If drinks or alcohol was bought on to the ship a duty would have to be paid.
In the afternoon we were taken to the Surprise caves. The ques were long , as there were many other tour companies arriving at the same time, this also occurred at the beach we visited.
The bar onboard, commence with happy hour over the duration of the tour, buy 2 get 1 free. The drinks were still cheapish (US$2/50VND but not in comparison to Hanoi town (10/15VND) wine was priced at US$30 and was TERRIBLE.
As part of the cost of the tour, we were told of a 20l keg was supplied for the paying customers. There was a clause, the "Free beer" was only for an hour. I found out from the tour guide, after an hour the beer was given to the crew. With that; I grabbed and empty 1.5l water bottle and filled this up before the hour was up, and shared this around once the keg was taken off us. ( apparently it was almost empty when they took it, and they werent happy)
Our tour guide tried to induce us to drink more by stating 'happy hour' was back on, and said you guys dont know how to "party". With that people were saying to him the drinks were expensive, why we had to pay US$1 for water etc. In the end, I think he was got annoyed about it and headed below deck.
our breakfast, was a rubbery fried egg, partially toasted bread, fried rice cake, and coffee. We were then told to "get off the boat" for a compulsory tour of a pearl farm. At the completion of the tour, we returned we conducted a "cooking class" , this was more like rolling up summer rolls for lunch, not actually cooking.
To sum it all up, the views were great the crowds werent, and this Company; Ha Long Golden bay cruise was the WORST!!
Top Tips;
Smuggle your own water and alcohol, keep it in your room.
Drink as much 'free beer' as you can, collect it in a large bottle (dont get caught)
Read reviews about other tour companies first.
I hope this helps.

Overnight cruises will cease in 2020
Mar 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends
There is so much competition on HaLong Bay for the tourist dollar, for both day trips & overnight cruises. Make sure you do some research beforehand to enable the best experience & value.
The Vietnamese government has declared that overnight cruises will not be permitted after 2020 (partly environmental but also driven by huge hotel development to ensure economic viability).
If this is on your bucket list, better get cracking!

Worth the trip
Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples
While it is three hours from Hanoi to the bay by car, and four if you're on a shared shuttle it is worth the trip if you spend a night on a cruise, or in a local hotel and do a day cruise. We did a two night cruise and I would say that the decision to spend that much time on the water depends on the weather at the time.
