Howard‚Äôs visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Other wordly
Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

I suffered a case of food poisoning and ended up at Halong City Hospital.
The people were kind and understanding and provided an interpreter and
my own room. They did all the tests and x-rays and gave me medicine.
The next day I was allowed to leave and cost me 4 million dong(200 aus)
Thanks again to the staff at Halong City Hospital.

Halong Bay is gorgeous. We loved swimming in the warm water. Kayaking was also great. We were glad we chose Dragon Pearl for the trip as there were not too many boats in the area we were in.

Halong bay boats
Oct 2013 ‚Ä¢ Family
I was in Halong bay several times before and always boat ride on clasical Vietnames boats was a very nice experience and boats were all nicely decorated in different shapes and colours. We wisited Halong Bay in the end of october 2013 and found out that all boats are painted in white - dissaster all those nice boats turned into old fishing wessels. They say that the mayor ordered all boats to be painted in white so that they can better see each other at night, the other option is that mayor wife has painting company. Whatever the truth is the boats now looks terible and more than 50% of the Halong bay experience is lost. I mean those hills are quite nice but if there is a charming boat floating by the picture is much nicer. Who would like to drive from Hanoi for almost 4 hours one way to see countless nicely shaped rocks standing from the sea covered with ugly, dirty white boats that looks like fishing sheeps in need of serious reapir.
Thats my experience in Ha Long bay which for me used to be one of highlights of Vietnam now it is a complete dissaster so don't go there and hopefully major will decide that boat owners can paint their boats as they wish, as they did before. Maybe Halong bay will get its charms back.

Know before you go
We spent 1 night on Marguerite junk cruising HaLong Bay. Our cost was $250.00 US for two including transportation, food, lodging and 2 bottles of water. Our toue director was Thang and he was very good. When we got to the bay we had to board a tender. The air was so poluted from the diesel fuel that I had difficulty breathing. it was very crowded. We got out to the junk boat and it was quite run down. The room was dark and dingy, the bathroom was dark and dirty and the steps were very steep and narrow.
As we cruised out to see the bay the black smoke coming from the back engines was choking as we ate at tables with the back windows opened. There were fans but they would not turn them on. No a/c until 8pm so we went to the top deck to get some air. The lounge chairs were broken down and it smelled horrible from the pollution in the bay. Such a shame.
we saw raw sweage being dumped and it was common to see tiolet paper that had not broken down yet, trash and oil floating on the surface.
I have enclosed photos because I would have liked to have seen what I was getting myself into and the other boasts out there were looking pretty sorry as well. If I would have Known I wouold have been prepared.
My best advice is to stay at a hotel then go out for a day tour. I can stay just about anywhere but I just wishI had known up front

Best Tour Company!
Feb 2013 ‚Ä¢ Couples
We used HalongSapa Tours for our tour of Halong Bay and they were great. We were unsure if we wanted to go to Bai Tu Long Bay or Halong and Cham at HalongSapa Tours walked us through the differences in the two areas. She also helped us to understand the differences between all of the possible boats we were looking at. Then when I finally booked the trip I messed up the date and she was able to get us on the same boat on the correct day. HanlongSapa Tours and Cham were fantastic!

Absolutely beautiful, magical in fact. A must on anyone's trip through Vietnam. There are day cruises and overnight ones. I recommend an overnight because waking up among these thousands of islands is an incredible experience.

Amazing trip in Halong Bay with Halongsapa Tours
Aug 2012 ‚Ä¢ Family
We dealt with a very delightful woman from Halongsapa Tours, her name is Cham, and her equally pleasant husband just as some reviewer on Tripdadvisor said. She took care of our travels in Vietnam.
The morning we woke up for the bus trip to Halong Bay from Hanoi, we found with disappointment that a typhoon (same as a hurricane) that was heading towards Hainan and North Vietnam from South China sea. A couple at our hotel said that their tour to Halong Bay was cancelled due to the storm so we thought our trip would be cancelled too. So we thought that our trip would be ruined by the weather, but the luck was on our side.
While we were being worried, we received a call from Cham (she gave us a cell phone in case of emergency), she said that the risk of the storm coming into Halong Bay was only a 50% chance and she would give us a full refund including free lunch and transportation cost if the trip was cancelled. We were still not so sure but we were still going because that‚Äôs the reason why we went to Vietnam. Four hours on shuttle bus was no fun and we did not feel relieved until we arrived the port and got on the boat.
To our surprise, the weather actually was beautiful and the sea was calm. My family and I stayed overnight on the Indochina Sails Premium, this boat has very nice handiwork on the wall by Vietnamese craftsmen and very elegant overall interior design. Our cabin has a private balcony so we had full privacy relaxing and enjoying Halong Bay. After a delicious lunch, we started to visit caves, did kayaking and visited the Titop Island. Lying on the sundeck, we had a great view of the mountains on the sea and took a lot of pictures.
Halong Bay is absolutely fantastic if you enjoy fishing too. My brothers and dad were really excited about the night squid fishing even although they didn‚Äôt catch any of them! For my mom and me, we were awed by the little boats selling fruit that we saw when we were sailing off the shore. The dinner was apparently a seafood feast! We enjoyed both the Vietnamese and international cuisines. They presented the dishes quite artistically and very delicious too. The staff welcomed us and always smiled to us while offering help during the dinner.
When visiting the ‚ÄúAmazing‚Äù Cave, we met a couple from Australia and a family from Canada and learned that their trips in Vietnam were also arranged by Cham. We had the same feelings about the company and we were glad to have chosen it. We were pleased by the services Cham and her husband at HaLongsapa Tours provided to us. They took care of us and made our trip an amazing one. I am proud with my family that I made a right choice when I arranged our trips within Vietnam with Cham, including flights and tours to Halong, Sapa, Hoi An and the Melkong Delta. I haven‚Äôt had time to write about all the places we went in Vietnam yet, but I hope to post some more reviews later.
The genuine and excellent services by Halongsapa Tours (halongsapatours.com) are worth every penny we paid. I would like to share our experience with you so you can make a choice if you are considering spending your nights on a cruise boat in Halong Bay.
