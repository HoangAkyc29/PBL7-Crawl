2 ngày 1 đêm trên vịnh quả thật tuyệt vời. Thật thanh bình. Được chèo kayaking, được đi thuyền nan. Ăn uống trên tầu, nghỉ ngơi, lên sundeck ngắm vịnh. 2 ngày trôi đi nhanh quá.

Trải nghiệm tuyệt vời
Ngủ đêm trên vịnh Hạ Long ở du thuyền 5* là một trải nghiệm thực sự đặc biệt. Lênh đênh trên vịnh, buổi tối lên ngắm sao ngày rằm, ngắm ánh đèn từ tầu khác rọi đến, ngắm mặt nước, ngắm núi non, thật yên bình.

Trải nghiệm 1 đêm trên du thuyền Ambassador Cruise 6* rất hài lòng, xứng đáng, chất lượng dịch vụ rất tốt, nhân viên nhiệt tình, quản lý cũng rất nhiệt tình, ăn uống bình thường ko ấn tượng lắm, nhưng cũng đáng trải nghiệm. Ngoài ra trải nghiệm ko tốt lắm tại Mường Thanh Center Hotel, checkin mất quá nhiều thời gian, chậm trễ, dù là khách sạn mới nhất HL nhưng không gian bên trong hơi bí bách

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

For those who love sunrise and sunset…
Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

The weather could have been better but we still had a great time on our cruiz. Amazing sights and a great tour guide makes for a fun time. There is also more to do around the bay but make sure to come in the spring to early fall for optimal experience.

Feb 2024 • Couples
The panoramic views of the limestone karsts jutting out of the emerald waters left us in awe. The luxurious cruises offered a peaceful escape from our busy lives, allowing us to relax and take in the beauty of our surroundings. We highly recommend this destination for any couple looking for a romantic getaway.

Our Halong Bay adventure
We felt like characters in a cheesy romance movie as we paddled through the majestic karst formations and explored the hidden caves and coves of Halong Bay. The stunning scenery provided cultural and artistic inspiration, while the kayaking added a touch of adventure. We even pretended we were pirates searching for hidden treasures! A perfect destination for couples seeking a mix of romance, exploration, and a good laugh.

The Floating Landfill Site
Such a beautiful place and truly amazing to see cliff after cliff in the shadows. Cruise was fantastic, the boat, the food and the activities

I came away from Ha Long Bay devastated about the level of trash and pollution and oil in the water. Spent my kayak trip picking up rubbish and refused to swim or snorkel!
I hope tourists put their money elsewhere until the government clean up the area for good. Allegedly they had a clean up almost every year...but I cleared several boxes, bottles and countless plastic gloves and bags on my kayak and I didn't even make a dent in the area we were in.
I've not seen this level of rubbish in any other South East Asian country, not saying it doesn't exist but they clearly do something with the problem

Dirty Halong Bay
Unpleasant experience - the sea was filthy with rubbish everywhere as the ship sails, dock and when we went for kayaking. It is very sad to see the UNESCO site was not preserved and well-maintained by the government. I did not like my cruise I have chosen and would not return to Halong Bay as it was not a pretty sight to see the rubbish on the sea.

Out of control water Pollution
Why or why when you have such a magical natural oasis do you spoil it by the Government mismanagement of the pollution of the water.Out of the millions of dollars earned from tourism could they not hire 2 tugs with a large net to sail up and down the channels to collect the hideous amount of litter in the water.SORT IT OUT
