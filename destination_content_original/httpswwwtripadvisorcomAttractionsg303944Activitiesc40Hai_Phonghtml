Nice
I’ve had a few massages here. And are very lovely and do a very nice job, my only complaint is when many other people are talking such as strangers maybe put into a separate room because then it is hard to enjoy! But I really enjoyed it here :)

Good and cheap
Lovely ladies who gave us each a full body massage. Really good pressure and felt so relaxed and good afterwards.
However a huge lack of privacy as there are 5 or so beds in one big room, while we were mid massage another couple came in and there's only a makeshift curtain put up between our groups.
