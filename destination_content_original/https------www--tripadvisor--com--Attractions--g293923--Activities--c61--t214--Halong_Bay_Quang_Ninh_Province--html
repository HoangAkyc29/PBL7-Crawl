Helpful staff!
The tour was really fun! The views were nice and the activities were fun as well. However I was already sick and felt more sick during the tour, but the tourguide took me to the hospital and translated for me. This didn‚Äôt have to do anything with the tour but the staff helped me a lot!

Wonderful 3 day cruise to LanHa Bay
We had a wonderful trip to Halong and LanHa Bay. We would definitely recommend the 3 day trip as we were able to explore more of the area. The boat was beautiful and the food delicious. The staff were great including Victor and Bobby our tour guides. Also Hoang in the office was extremely helpful returning an item to me which I had left on the bus. I would thoroughly recommend this company. Excellent value for money.

Sight seeing in Hanoi
Our tour in Hanoi was part of a package we took with Odinovo. I must stress the professionalism, adaptability and enthusiasm the guide Duong Van Nghia has demonstrated. Good knowledge not only of history but also of Vietnamese culture. He would go out of his way to help us with many different issues. Felt so secure while having him around that he would take care of whatever situation would arise. Also the driver was excellent ,very competent and smooth driving

go if you can.
What a brilliant trip. Although it cost a lot of $ it was the trip of a lifetime . We went on Ponant expedition cruise from Dunedin in NZ for a 21 day cruise visiting many subantarctic islands ( including Macquarie Island ) and the Ross sea. We had plenty of landings on zodiacs to places such as Shackletons Hut and
Scotts Hut and lots of places to see wildlife ( penguins galore, elephant seals, birdlife but also mega herbs). The Naturalists on board were brilliant and made the trip . Very comfortable ship ( Le Soleil ) with only 180 passengers . Its a must if you can manage it

Great experience
We really enjoyed our two days boat trip and were lucky with the weather, which can be cloudy and rather cool during this time of the year. Our guide Duke told us a lot about the area and was very friendly and caring. He knew how to avoid the crowds and showed us some special spots, that not everyone sees. We can definitely recommend the agency.
