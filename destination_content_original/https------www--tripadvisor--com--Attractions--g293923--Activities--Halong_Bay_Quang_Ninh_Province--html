2. Bai Tu Long Bay
961
Bai Tu Long Bay is the name of an area located in the east of Halong Bay Vietnam. Although it shares many similar geological characters with Halong Bay, Bai Tu Long Bay is considered as off the beaten tourist track with many deserted and pristine beaches, no less impressive karst mountains. The Bay has a rich biodiversity with two ecosystems: a tropical, moist, evergreen rainforest ecosystem; and a marine and coastal ecosystem. The area has scarcely seen any tourist development. A large number of guests, through online research, wish to visit the Bai Tu Long Bay because it is much less crowded than Halong Bay. The only disadvantage is that it does not have many grottos. The nearest place for a visit (Vung Vieng Fishing village) is at around 20 km from tourist port.

Our Halong Bay Adventure
In Halong Bay, we found ourselves immersed in the spectacular and serene beauty of the surroundings. The picturesque seascapes took our breath away as we sailed through the emerald waters surrounded by towering limestone islands. We indulged in delicious seafood fresh from the bay, which made our dining experience unforgettable. Exploring the stunning caves and kayaking through hidden lagoons added an adventurous twist to our romantic getaway. Halong Bay truly exceeded our expectations, leaving us in awe of its natural wonders. It's a must-visit destination for any couple seeking a peaceful and beautiful escape.

Great 3 days
3 of us all went on the 3 day 2 night tour. We all had a great time and met so many friends that we ended up catching up with multiple times after the tour. Would highly recommend this tour if your solo and wanting to make friends quick and easily. No wifi for 3 days meant everyone was always talking and socializing. The food is pretty average but the drinks are dirt cheap. Expect to have sand though everything by the end off the tour. Unfortunately the showers were also cold. The staff were great however were not as involved as you would expect. Overall had an amazing 3 days and would 100% recommend to those who love to party.

Excellent but not what I expected
Did the two day one night trip.Note you start around noon and finish around noon the following day. The boat travels through some of the islands, beautiful, then anchors before picking up anchor the following day to return. Whilst at a chor there are various excursions. Food accommodation and crew excellent what I saw was beautiful. Would do two one day excursions next time. One way or the other I would not miss.

Sad to see many PET bottle garbage
The island is named after Russian cosmonaut. This was the first stop during the tour. We were asked to choose either, hiking or swimming. We chose hiking. It was quite a tough one! It was really a hot and humid day. The stairs are quite steep and narrow. There were lots of tourists, you needed to walk carefully for up and down , not to slip or hit.
The view from top was beautiful. You get sweaty!
We saw people swimming at beach. Looked fun in such a hot day at less wave beach.
It was very sad to see tons of PET bottle garbage were not only in trash bins but also everywhere in the island. Maybe tourists brought drinks here and threw them away when finished. When we entered the cruise ship, we were asked not to bring in PET bottles. Only glass bottles were sold in the cruise ship. So there should have be no PET bottles in the island but there were.
We must behave to preserve the great nature.

Halong Bay symbol
These are two rocks emerging from the sea, however with an interesting form of two chicken fighting or kissing.
As our tour guide explained, they became a symbol o Halong Bay with many souvenirs with them.

good excursion and great view of the city !
This is the next stop right after our Halong bay cruise. The cable car ride to get to the complex was quite interesting-- as it passed a 188m point, a world-record. The ride on the big wheel, the main attraction, was great -- got to see the beautiful bay as well as the Halong city. Can spend some time to stroll around the Japanese garden too.

Interesting if you're already in the area
An interesting place to find out about the area and it's industrial, artistic and cultural heritage. It's a good way to enjoy an air conditioned couple of hours if you have time to spare.
