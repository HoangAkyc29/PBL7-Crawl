Points of Interest & Landmarks
Mekong River CruiseCai - Rang Floating Market Tours - Touring a floating market in the Mekong Delta is a box that many travellers to Saigon wish to check, and none are bigger, or more popular than the Can Tho’s Cai Rang Floating Market.The Cai Rang Floating Market, the largest wholesale floating market in the Mekong Delta, starts around 04:00 and runs until 10:00, meaning that you’ll have to get an early start of the day if you want to visit.The market is about six kilometres from Can Tho, or about a 40-minute boat ride. While floating down the river, you get a glimpse of life along its shores. You’ll pass vibrantly painted boats anchored along the shore, merchant vessels carrying loads down the river and houses built on stilts over the water.Once you finally reach the market, it’s an impressive site. A stretch of boats selling all variety of goods lines the river.

The museum has three themes: Tarology, Cartomancy and Occult. The museum has a large variety of objects from 15th century to 21th century.

Market with a Mekong cruise
We did a cruise trip for 2 days from Caibe. Tour finished in Cantho and we visited the market. I could not see many boats, but good enough to see. People move to live on land and the market is mostly for tourists.

The monastery.
To visit Truc Lam Phuong Nam Can Tho Zen Monastery, take a look around from the outside to the inside, the first highlight of the temple is a very large area with many large items such as: the three-way gate, the main hall, the bell tower. , drum tower, post hall, ... all share a common shade of red-brown tile with large wooden pillars and the foundation is made of solid stone.

The high and wide gate is built in the way of a curved attic, roofed with red tiles. In the middle of the gate is a wooden sign engraved with gilded braille "Southern Truc Lam Zen Monastery"; Below the signboards on both sides of the gate are two statues of Vi Da Ho Phap (Mr. Thien) on the left and a statue of Tieu Dien Dai Si (Mr. Evil) on the right. In general, the three entrances to the monastery are very eye-catching at first glance when exuding a majestic, modern but very traditional image.
Through the entrance gate is a spacious bright red brick courtyard leading to the main hall, visitors will see 2 rows of marble statues of Arhats placed in parallel. At the foot of each statue are engraved the names of heroes who have defended and built the country.

Interesting insight into how chocolate is made by hand
Our visit to Muoi Cong Cocoa Farm was quite the eye-opener. It was our first time seeing chocolate made by hand, and this place offers a thorough look into every step of the process. Tasting 100% pure chocolate straight from the press was unique, and seeing the entire process from bean to the final product was fascinating.
They also offer a choice of hot or cold cocoa. If you're curious about chocolate making, this farm is definitely worth a visit

Small but beautiful Vietnamese Pagoda
Wednesday afternoon on the 9th January and we visited this Vietnamese Pagoda, which is situated near the centre of Can Tho. Our visit was scheduled as part of our Tour, and our Guide, Ha, was most knowledgeable and informative.
In the grounds in front of the Pagoda is a large statue of a smiling Buddha and nearby a statue of Guanyin, Godess of Mercy. The presence of male and female Dieties symbolises that all are welcome, both male and females. That is one of the major difference between a Vietnamese Pagoda and other Temples, which are exclusively for males.
At the front of the Pagoda are 3 gates, 2 smaller ones on either side of a larger one, the large gate is so that the Gods can pass through and the 2 smaller ones for guests and worshippers to pass through.
This 2 storey Pagoda, is a striking building with its red pillars, roof tiles and ornate roof. On the ground floor is the main Shrine is located along with other religious items. We also climbed the small staircase to the first floor where the old bell is housed along with more religious items and images.
To the side of the Pagoda is a tall ornate tower, which is the tomb of a Monk.
On entering the Pagoda, visitors are asked to remove their shoes and to wear appropriate clothing.
A beautiful Pagoda well worth a visit.

Khmer Pagoda
Many of the Hotels and tourist attractions in Can Tho City, are in the Hai Ba Trung road area, and its surroundings. A good planning before visiting this site, helps to maximise the available time at hand and avoids unnecessary traveling up and down searching for a missed attraction.
We were staying at Kim Too hotel which is also located on Hai Ba Trung road. We planned and followed a circuit on foot as follows.
Kim Too Hotel→ 150 meters→ Ong Temple → 20 meters across the road → Ho Chi Minh Memorial → 90meters → Niem Kiew Wharf → 300meters → Can Tho Night market road → 500 meters→ Phat Hoc Temple→ 90 meters across the road → Munirang say temple → 250 meters→ Tarot Museum → 500meters→ Bao Tang Quan Khu 9 (War Museum) → 260meters→ Can Tho Museum→ 230meters→ Kham Lon Can Tho ( Prison Provinciale-Colonial Prison)→ 500meters → Ninh Kieu Pedestrian bridge ( Cau di bo Ben Ninh Kieu) → 400 meters →Kim Too Hotel.
It was following this scheme that we reached Munirang say Temple.
This is a golden coloured Buddhist temple just across the road from Phat Hoc Buddhist temple and decided to check it out. It is built in the Khmer Angkor architecture style and is very impressive.
We explored the ground floor and then walked up the stairs to the area of worship. You need to remove your shoes to enter the area of worship where the buddha is sited on a golden throne on an altar.
The monks were welcoming and helpful. We spent about 30 minits here.
