Best day trip we done in Da Nang
The trip here was not planned at all in advance but turned out to be one of the best things we did. We caught a grab from our hotel and they drove us to the parking area, the roads are rather windy but had fab views as you went up. When we arrived we saw a few monkeys wandering around which was great. Really surprised that there is no entrance fee for here. What we loved was how much there was too see, the stunning views and how quiet it was as it was so large and spread out. Happily spent about an hour here, probably could have done longer if it wasn't the middle of of day and really hot

Awe inspiring example of Buddhist religion
Great panoramic views from this sacred site of the sea and surrounding area. Many instagram photos in the courtyard around the Lady Buddha and pagodas. Unique fauna and flora combined with numerous Chinese and Vietnamese statues. Spend two hours and you won‚Äôt regret.

Must visit in Da Nang
Landed in Vietnam, took a break and got a grab car to reach this place at around 4 pm and with wonderful cloudy weather it was just mesmerizing. Lady Buddha - majestic and so blissful standing tall and visible from large parts of coastal da nang. Just so beautiful with all the trees, sculptures and pagodas. Entry is free. Plenty of parking available and getting here is no trouble at all. The view of the coastline and the beaches at sunset is eye soothing. The place is also called monkey mountains but we hardly saw any this day. Must visit !

Iconic Lady Buddha Statue!
This enormous statue overlooks the sea towards the city of Da Nang. It is the tallest statue in the area and is situated within a wonderful park village. There was no admittance charge! Also many great views of Da Nang from this point!

Beautiful statues
We loved walking around and seeing all of the beautiful statues. Lady Buddha is about 67 meters tall and we could see her from Hoi An. We did see a few monkeys running around which was cool. It's too bad people litter so much.

Da Nang highlight
The well manicured site containing a range of interesting gardens in conjunction with the Buddhist religious temples and the Lady Buddha statue. Even if you are not religious the site has much to offer in terms of architecture and garden design. The site was meticulously maintained when we visited. There are areas where there is informative material that will enable a degree of understanding of Buddhist culture. You need to have at least an hour to fully appreciate what the site has to offer. If you go to Da Nang and do not visit the Lady Buddha you have missed the best part.

A must visitüëçüèº
What a fantastic area to visit, photo opportunities are endless and the whole area is very impressive. We were advised to get there early which paid off massively, got there 7.30ish Sunday morning and pretty much had the place to ourselves for half an hour although when we were leaving it was getting busier. This is a must doüëçüèº

Lady Buddha a must see in Da Nang
A must see, what an amazing sculpture that looks over the East China Sea Danang. A must see while in Da Nang. The temples are amazing. Note the gift shop is closed from 11.30 - 1.30

The intricate carvings and statues of the Lady Buddha are truly breathtaking
I found the experience to be very enlightening and calming. The place itself is a beautiful sight to behold. The intricate carvings and statues of the Lady Buddha are truly breathtaking and make for a great photo opportunity. The grounds are well maintained and the atmosphere is peaceful and serene.

Beautiful lady Buddha.
Dec 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family
December time, the sun sets around 5.15pm. we reached there around 3.45 pm and prayed first.
around 4pm, the weather is nice and cooling to venture around the grounds. the place is peaceful and beautiful especially during sunset time. it is easy to book a grab ride from city but our hotel told us that it is sometimes difficult to get a ride back...so we booked the driver for return trip too.

Towering Statue of Quan √Çm Lady buddha overlooking the habour and ƒê√† N·∫µng city. A very beautiful setting for worship as well as for picture taking. This is the 3rd of the 3 Linh ·ª®ng temples. The first one is in one of the marble mountains. The second Linh ·ª®ng is in the B√† N√† Hills. Sacred to locals.

Even in Oct it was very hot out here so bring a hat or shade of some kind. The Statute is very impressive, and the gardens were still beautiful even though being cleaned up after the typhoon. Lots to see and take in.

Worth a stop if you're visiting Son Tra (monkey mountain)
Buildings and gardens are well maintained.
Some macaques can be observed.
Might be a little crowded but
Entrance is free and it's on the way to son tra monkey mountain, give it a try !

Very impressive to visit
Dec 2019
We used a grab taxi from the hotel we stayed at on the beach. It is short ride and is much more impressive when you get there than it appears from a distance. There is more than just the Lady Buddha, such as Temples and also unexpectedly quite tame monkeys although I would not suggest trying to pet them at all. We spent a little over an hour there.

Great statue and even better views!
Mar 2020
We rented a scooter for a day and decided to go up the 'Monkey Mountain'. The views on the way up are spectacular. We stopped a few times just to appreciate it fully. The Lady Buddha statue is massive and quite impressive. The surrounding gardens are lovely too and of course the pagodas. And we also saw monkey which is a massive BONUS for me :) overall a great half a day out.
