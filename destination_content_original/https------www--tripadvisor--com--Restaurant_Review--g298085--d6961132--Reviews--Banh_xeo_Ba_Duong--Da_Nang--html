I've had better
We thought we would check this out after watching a couple of you tube videos. As indicated, it is at the end of an alley. Place was busy. We tried the Banh Xeo as well as the pork skewers. We had already had Banh Xeo twice since we've been Vietnam. Once in Ho Chi Minh and once at the Son Tra Market. I have to say this would be by least favorite so far. The pork skewers were great! The Banh Xeo not so much. I found it to thick and oily, not like the other two we had. Everyone there however looked like they were enjoying it. It was edible, and the fresh herbs, sprouts and cucumbers were tasty when rolled up together. However, what I didn't like was their "sauce". It was clearly a thick gravy, the kind you have when you make meatballs and gravy. It didn't appeal to me at all, especially on fresh vegetables and lettuce. I was so looking forward to a light tasty dipping sauce. However, like I said, those there liked it. Just be prepared their "dipping sauce" is a gravy. If you don't mind it, then you will enjoy it.

Best bánh xèo in Đà Nẵng???
My family can’t get enough of bánh xèo. Since we moved to Da Nang, there’s no other cuisine that we’ve eaten more of. Heard from everyone that this is the spot. Took us a few months to try it, but we finally did and were very happy. It’s down at the very end of a tiny alley with a couple of other bánh xèo joints nearby. Bánh xèo was solid, prices were right, service was quick, and dipping sauce was very good. Can we say that it’s definitively the best place in town? Hard to say, we’ve eaten some really delicious bánh xèo here. But Bánh Xèo Bà Dưỡng is definitely up there and we’ll be back often.

Best Nem Nuong sticks & Dipping sauce!
Second time coming here and I can assure you there will be a third time and so forth whenever I'm in Vietnam again.
The food here is just so damn good with the dipping sauce they have. Everything is cooked to perfection and their signature dish or most popular is the nem nuong sticks with the rice paper rolls wrapped in veggies.
A must whenever you're here but don't forget to try their other meat dishes too.
Despite being insanely busy the two times I've dined here, the staff still managed to seat my entire family down within 5 minutes or so and already taking orders with food and drinks coming shortly after.
If it's your first time coming here, be sure to walk all the way to the end of the alley and locate the right restaurant at the end of it which isn't hard to miss since it'll be swarming with customers eating here.
Only small concern is noticing staff reusing left over rice papers from other tables when customers are leaving but otherwise can't be helped as we're in Vietnam eating at a busy local small restaurant so the delicious food makes you forget this.

Iconic place in Danang
Delicious crispy pancakes (banh xeo) and grilled meat (nem lui). They are the must order dishes when you are there. Remember to wrap them in rice paper with fresh herbs, dip in the sauce and prepare to be blown away. An iconic place of Danang

great local food
you must try this place, super delicious. But because they use a lot of oil so you have to eat it fast when it still hot

Great Bahn Xeo
This was our first time trying Bahn Xeo and it was delicious. We were here as part of a food tour and would never have picked this place ourselves. We also had some grilled beef and Tiger beer which were also very good. Everything was very fresh and the peanut dipping sauce was a great accompaniment. If you can find it try it out.

Friendly staff, amazing food!
It's my first time trying Banh Xeo so I didn't know how to wrap the cake but thankfully, the server was there to show me how. It was very good and their dipping sauce was so flavorful that I finished the whole plate before my husband!

Fantastic Banh Xeo
Loved the Banh Xeo. It was a great place for foods that have little or no MSG. The cleanest food that we had in Da Nang. If you loved Banh Xeo, this won't disappoint.

Okay, it's a tourist trap, but it deserves all the hype
Okay, it's a tourist trap, but it deserves all the hype. The Bánh Xèo (Rice Pancake) with Nem Lụi (Meat Skewers) are excellent. This is what every traveller should try when visiting Vietnam - it just screams local and the atmosphere here is made to match.

Best meal in DaNang
We had the Vietnamese pancakes, beef, and pork satay for 10 people. Service was super fast. It was the most delicious meal we had in DaNang. Highly recommend. The shrimp had the head and shell but it’s super soft and easily swallowable.

Fast, friendly service
We found this restaurant listed under must eat specialities in Danang. This place is a little off the beaten path but worth finding. The pancake & peanut sauce are delicious. Would recommend.
