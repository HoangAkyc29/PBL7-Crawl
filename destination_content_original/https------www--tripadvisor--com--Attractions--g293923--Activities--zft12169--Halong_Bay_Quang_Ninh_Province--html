HALONG off the beaten track
We had a wonderful morning with Si from KAB Travel HaLong Bay who took us to the main tourist places of interest in HaLong as well as to local places well off the tourist track. Eating amazing chicken noodle soup in a local street side cafe and drinking Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk high up in the hills were memorable experiences.
Si was very courteous, efficient and caring. He guided me through the slippery fish market and over the busy roads. His English was excellent and he was just a lovely person to be with.
The pagoda we visited with him was the best we saw all holiday , so peaceful and calm.
I would thoroughly recommend Si and his company.

Halong Bay symbol
These are two rocks emerging from the sea, however with an interesting form of two chicken fighting or kissing.
As our tour guide explained, they became a symbol o Halong Bay with many souvenirs with them.

good excursion and great view of the city !
This is the next stop right after our Halong bay cruise. The cable car ride to get to the complex was quite interesting-- as it passed a 188m point, a world-record. The ride on the big wheel, the main attraction, was great -- got to see the beautiful bay as well as the Halong city. Can spend some time to stroll around the Japanese garden too.

Awesome crew and boat
Highly recommend this ship and cruise. Small ship (only 8 cabins) but they keep you entertained! There is a cooking class, squid fishing, royal dinner, excursions to a cave and river rafting or kayaking. The staff are amazing and the food is 5 star. If you are looking for an amazing cruise, this is it! Note: we did the one night cruise.

Great chef and authentic experience
We really had a great time doing to cooking class with Thuy. The place is very beautiful, surrounded by a garden - very cozy atmosphere. We were allowed choose a menu ourselfes out of five options and it was delicious. Before the class you visit the market, which is so cool to see since you have a local with you. The cooking class itself is a lot of fun and you get so many useful tips. We can't wait to cook all the recepies back home. I can definately recommend you to do Thuy's cooking class, it's a blast!

Fabulous experience in Halong Bay.
We have done both the 3 day Halong Bay cruise with Indochina Junk (2016) & the 1 night cruise ( March 2024) and both have been excellent. We have chosen the smaller boats both times and it has been a lovely experience. The cabins were small but lovely and the food and experiences excellent. We loved the Kayaking particularly. Both trips were very well organised & the arrangements all worked well. The company goes to the much less touristy Bai Tu bay which is so much quieter & very beautiful

Great service!
Booked a drive from Halong Bay to Cat Bi airport. The driver came on time, it was a smooth and quiet ride. There was WiFi in the car and the driver gave us water bottle. And to top it off the price was half the price our hotel asked for.
