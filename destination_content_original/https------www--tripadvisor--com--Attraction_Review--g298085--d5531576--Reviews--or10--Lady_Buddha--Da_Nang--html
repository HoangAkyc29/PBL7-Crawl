Best day trip we done in Da Nang
The trip here was not planned at all in advance but turned out to be one of the best things we did. We caught a grab from our hotel and they drove us to the parking area, the roads are rather windy but had fab views as you went up. When we arrived we saw a few monkeys wandering around which was great. Really surprised that there is no entrance fee for here. What we loved was how much there was too see, the stunning views and how quiet it was as it was so large and spread out. Happily spent about an hour here, probably could have done longer if it wasn't the middle of of day and really hot

Awe inspiring example of Buddhist religion
Great panoramic views from this sacred site of the sea and surrounding area. Many instagram photos in the courtyard around the Lady Buddha and pagodas. Unique fauna and flora combined with numerous Chinese and Vietnamese statues. Spend two hours and you won‚Äôt regret.

Must visit in Da Nang
Landed in Vietnam, took a break and got a grab car to reach this place at around 4 pm and with wonderful cloudy weather it was just mesmerizing. Lady Buddha - majestic and so blissful standing tall and visible from large parts of coastal da nang. Just so beautiful with all the trees, sculptures and pagodas. Entry is free. Plenty of parking available and getting here is no trouble at all. The view of the coastline and the beaches at sunset is eye soothing. The place is also called monkey mountains but we hardly saw any this day. Must visit !

Iconic Lady Buddha Statue!
This enormous statue overlooks the sea towards the city of Da Nang. It is the tallest statue in the area and is situated within a wonderful park village. There was no admittance charge! Also many great views of Da Nang from this point!

Beautiful statues
We loved walking around and seeing all of the beautiful statues. Lady Buddha is about 67 meters tall and we could see her from Hoi An. We did see a few monkeys running around which was cool. It's too bad people litter so much.

Da Nang highlight
The well manicured site containing a range of interesting gardens in conjunction with the Buddhist religious temples and the Lady Buddha statue. Even if you are not religious the site has much to offer in terms of architecture and garden design. The site was meticulously maintained when we visited. There are areas where there is informative material that will enable a degree of understanding of Buddhist culture. You need to have at least an hour to fully appreciate what the site has to offer. If you go to Da Nang and do not visit the Lady Buddha you have missed the best part.

A must visitüëçüèº
What a fantastic area to visit, photo opportunities are endless and the whole area is very impressive. We were advised to get there early which paid off massively, got there 7.30ish Sunday morning and pretty much had the place to ourselves for half an hour although when we were leaving it was getting busier. This is a must doüëçüèº

The intricate carvings and statues of the Lady Buddha are truly breathtaking
I found the experience to be very enlightening and calming. The place itself is a beautiful sight to behold. The intricate carvings and statues of the Lady Buddha are truly breathtaking and make for a great photo opportunity. The grounds are well maintained and the atmosphere is peaceful and serene.

Terrific Temple and best Da Nang bay views
Jan 2024 ‚Ä¢ Family
Lady Buddha is a magnificent temple complex located on a small peninsula north from Da Nang. It's easy reachable with taxi (Grab) with a few bucks 10-15 min ride.
Main star is the tallest Lady Buddha statue in all southeast Asia, but apart from it you can visit the Monastery complex with library, kitchen, etc... No fee entry.
From the Temple premises are amazing views of Da Nang bay with its high rises.
Count on around 1,5 - 2 hours for entire visit including transportation.

This is a "MUST SEE"
Dec 2022
If you ever visit Danang you must visit the Lady Buddha, perched on a hill at Son Tra, a little north of the city. We decided to walk there and get a taxi back, it is about 8 kms from Dragon Bridge but a nice walk along the beach and the winding road at the base of the mountain. It is easy to spend at least 2 hours here as there is so much to see nearby, including pagodas, temples. The statue is 67m tall and i believe the highest in Vietnam and you can see it from many parts of the city.

Ohh what a place this is. The view from the temple, of the city, overlooking the sea is mesmerizing. The area is well maintained, and you could easily spend 2-3 hours here. Drive to the temple is also very soothing.

Fabulous array of Bonsai.
Feb 2024 ‚Ä¢ Couples
The site is well maintained, plenty of shade and public toilets. Ladies can‚Äôt enter one of the areas in shorts, but they have wraps you can borrow to cover your knees. Great views across the water to the Da Nang skyline. There is a concession store selling ice creams and drinks at reasonable prices not inflated tourist prices. We took a grab from the Novotel Premium Han River Hotel for 155 VND. The driver said he would wait for 2 hours and then take us back. We were finished in 1 hour and he took us back to the Novotel for the same price.

White marble Lady Buddha.
Nov 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family
We never heard about Lady Budha and temple for her amazed us. Such a big statue of white marble of Goddess / Lady Buddha facing sea is beautiful. We took numerous pictures around her . Atmosphere at afternoon time is pleasant . Place is quite neat and clean . You can spend about 1 hour relishing beautiful environs / sceneary here . However, lady Buddha statue is one of the highest in Danang / Vietnam which is visible from far of the places in Danang.

magnificent and solemn
Sep 2023 ‚Ä¢ Solo
i came here on 11 September when i stayed in da nang for two nights. lady buddha statue here is the tallest in vietnam, it is magnificent and solemn, it located at linh ung pagoda area, you can visit both in one day, you can see Da Nang city here also, beautiful city view. The statue stands facing the sea, with one hand praying and the other one holding a pitcher of nectar, as if she is blessing the fishermen who were reaching out to sea for a peaceful and successful crop. many tourists love to take pictures with lady buddha, as if doing so, will get protected by lady buddha, i am one of them too, haha. besides lady buddha, there is also a statue of laughing buddha, just standing in front of the lady buddha statue. both are important to Buddhists, if you came here, remember to pay respect to them, and also praying here.

Calm and Serene Location
Jan 2023
The statue is located along with a temple on a hill side. The location is calm and serene. From the top, one can see the sea and the city. Location is great for taking pictures.

There is ample parking on the spot.
