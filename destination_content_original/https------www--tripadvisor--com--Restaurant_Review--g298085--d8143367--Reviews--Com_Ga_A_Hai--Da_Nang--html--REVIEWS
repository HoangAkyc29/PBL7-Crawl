Tasteless food
It was recommended to us by the hotel receptionist as being "the place" to eat traditional chicken with rice, but it was a dissapointment. Reaching the place we saw that local people eat there so we had high expectations. Unfortunately, the food was tasteless. ðŸ˜’

Right next door to our Hotel
What a find.... 52k dong ($3 AUD) for a deliciously large roasted chicken and rice + side dish, sauce and soup. Great Bargain and very tasty...bring your own napkin to wipe your hands as they only provide paper.

Nice Roasted Chicken Rice
Stumbled upon this restaurant by chance and we weren't disappointed. The roasted chicken was crispy and the rice was delicious. For 52,000 VND I think it's value as the serving portion was good size.
