Một thắng cảnh đẹp. Đắt đỏ, dịch vụ tốt
thg 6 năm 2015 • Một mình
Tôi đến đây vào một ngày nắng nóng mùa hè. Tôi có thuê một chiếc thuyền để du ngoạn. Những hòn đá nổi trên mặt nước thật huyèn bí. Giống cảnh trong phim Avanta. Ngoài đây giá dịch vụ khá đắt đó. Các bạn phải trả giá nếu có sử dụng hay mua bán ở đây.

Đẹp và đắt đỏ
thg 7 năm 2015
Tôi đến với Hạ Long vào những ngày đầu hè nắng nóng trên 40 độ C. Mặc cái nóng oi ả như thiêu đốt, Hạ Long vẫn khiến người đến mê say như lạc vào thế giới cổ tích thần tiên. Cảnh đẹp như tranh vẽ. Thiên nhiên yên bình và hùng vỹ. Chúng tôi du ngoạn trên tàu 4 sao, trải qua 1 đêm ở HL rất thú vị. Có điều khi đến với HL, như hầu hết mọi người đều biết, dịch vụ rất đắt đỏ. Chúng tôi không bị chặt chém vì mọi giá cả đều được niêm yết, nhưng bạn nên chuẩn bị sẵn tâm lý khi du ngoạn ở đây. Vì là tàu 4 sao, nên 1 ly trà đá cũng có giá 40,000 vnd :)

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Other wordly
Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

A UNESCO world heritage site. Gorgeous, emerald bay with thousands of karsts and small islands. Visited a small fishing village and pearl farm here as well and went kayaking. Well worth the visit! Please hold onto your stuff and keep the bay clean.

Jul 2022 • Friends
Spent a day and night on the Bay as part of a longer group tour. It was incredible. We cruised the bay, went kayaking, sat on the deck and watched the stars, and laughed at the terrible karaoke howls from the nearby boats. In summer 2022 it still seems quiet post Covid. A must do bucket list item!

Ha Long Bay is very quite and calm place. Extremely beautiful, I wonder whether you can find such a place in any where else in the world. We stay one night in Amanda Cruise . Very nice and friendly staff. It is about 165 km from Hanoi. We had early breakfast from the hotel. On the way to Ha Long bay stopped to see the Pearl Factory. Reached the Cruise around 2.00 pm.

We did 2 days and regretted that we should have done for 3 days. We had only nearly 1 full day to enjoy the scenery and services on cruise. It's rush. We had to spend much time for transfers from/to Hanoi. So do 3 days if you can. It's worth visiting!

Ha Long bay is a bit like Krabi & Pha Nga bay but more beautiful with a much bigger archipelago.

Perfect place for couples to go on a boat tour for a night or two.
A shame though to see how much garbage there are in the sea nowadays.

The mists of Halong Bay ...
Jan 2020
So much has already been written about "Halong Bay" ... I'll be quite brief. As a Unesco 1994 appointed "World Heritage Site", "Halong Bay" is absolutely unmissable by all those travelling in Northeast Vietnam and Hanoi area. Its magic mists will definitely bewitch you! Emerald waters and infinite towering limestone isles, islets and caves topped by lush rainforests. All aging 20 million years! Board a boat (and there are very many different options from simple junks to luxury cruises) and discover the secrets of "Halong Bay". In Vietnamese, "Halong" means "Descending Dragon" - just like a mythological dragon descending from heaven and breaking through the limestones rocks and deep waters of the bay! A miracle of endless beauty! Enjoy!
