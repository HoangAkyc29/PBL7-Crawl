Great tour
I really enjoyed trip from Hue to Hai Van pass and back on motorbike. It took me almost entire day but it was worth it. Road is curvy and not in bad shape and the views from top was astonishing.

Must see place
Hai Van pass is a must see place. Entire road looks amazing with lots of viewpoints. Better to explore it by motorbike, but stay away from tracks and crazy busses

Coast line
To get to Hoi An from Hue, we chose a course to use this road. This road is along with a coast and you enjoy the view of continuous sea. We had a great ride. A highway with tunnel was built and it was said that Hai Van pass wouldn’t be used much but it is still used for scenic views and cost. At the top, there’s a fortress but not accessible.

one of the best costal road in the world
i visited here on 7 September,that day,i had a one day tour by minivan,we totally six persons, departed from Hue city ,and heading to Hoi An,High Van pass is the third stop of our one day trip.The pass once formed the boundary between the kingdoms of Dai viet (now vietnam) and champa in 1306, also it forms a boundary between the climates of northern and southern Vietnam. so during the winter months, weather on the north side of the pass is wet and cold, while the south side is warm and dry.The pass is renowned for its scenic beauty. someone called it “a deserted ribbon of perfection—one of the best coast roads in the world.” there is a High Van Quan relic,it is a military architecture, but unfortunately it was blocked by fence, cannot access to it. we just overlooking Da Nang city,Lang Co beach at the viewing platform,taking pictures,also had a look at some souvenirs stalls,after that we continued our journey.

READ THIS IF TRAVELLING HOI AN -> HUE
Aug 2022 • Couples
We embarked on the hai van pass expecting a relaxing journey when it wasn’t really that. We hired one motorbike between 2 of us and got our hostel to send our bags. The roads from Hoi An - Da Nang are fine but through Da Nang it got very busy and you need to have some road motorbike experience. The pass itself had some beautiful views, if somewhat short (I think only 20km) with limited food options (perhaps some closures due to covid?).

We weren’t sure where the ‘viewpoints’ were and wish we planned our stops before starting so plan your route and stops before.
After the Hai Van Pass, if you are heading all the way to Hue you must be warned - the rest of the 70km is a Highway road (feels like a motorway). It is VERY busy and you need to have high concentration for about 2 hours. We also hit this road at rush hour so plan your journey so that you set off early to miss this !!
We would recommend doing the Hai Van pass - it is worth it and waterfall stops along the way are beautiful (Suoi Mo waterfall). But do your research, set off early and be prepared:).

Disappointment. The road itself is ok and there are some truly nice views. But after riding couple of days and hundreds of kilometers in the beautiful and empty, amazing mountain roads of Ho Chi Minh trail closer to the Laos border, Hai Van Pass felt really crowded and not impressing. Especially the highest point where people have used to take cool photos, was stuffed with people and was a true tourist trap. If you are looking for nice roads to motorbike, consider QL14/15 (Prao - Khe Sanh - Phong Nha) instead, which is a bomb over this short and crowded one.

On our way from Hue to Hoi An, the tour group I was with made a rest stop here. Great views, including that of beaches and the city of Da Nang. It was a bit cold and windy here, so a hot cup of Vietnamese coffee hit the spot.

For all the hype surrounding the hai van pass, and the claims of 'one of the best driving roads in the world' I expected something special.......when in actual fact, it's mediocre at best. Many fuel tankers use the pass as they are not permitted to take the tunnel. The road surface in places has been repaired badly, other spots are peppered with pot holes. The Omega pass between Nha Trang and Dalat is better, but still suffers from dodgy surface in places.
In summary, this is not one of the best driving roads in the world, there are easily better to be found in Europe - the mountain regions of Swiss/Italian/German borders for instance.

When it comes to train travel I believe I've done my far share: Trans Mongolian, Tibet, around Europe etc...seen some sights as far as train travel goes. As for the Hai Van Pass this is one of those 'look out of the carriage window' in awe moment. What better way to arrive in Danang after a night on a sleeper train this this sight...

So glad we did it

What a day this was for us. We had seen them do it on Topgear, on there mopeds. We were in a nice tour car, with our guide. We stopped for Oysters with peanuts, before the long climb. We stopped a few times to take photos, as there are many places you can pull over. It is so high you are in cloud whe you are at your highest point.

Hired a scooter in Hoi An and really enjoyed the cruise. The road is a little bumpy and narrow. Trucks and buses tend to drift into your lane, so keep your wits about you. The views are great. Can be a little cool, pack a jacket.
Be smart and you’ll have a great ride.
