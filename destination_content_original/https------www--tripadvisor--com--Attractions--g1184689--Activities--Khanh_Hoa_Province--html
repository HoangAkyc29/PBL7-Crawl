Art Galleries
Long Thanh's photographic repertoire is unique as its wide-ranging. His landscapes are often moody, contrasting the natural beauty of Vietnam with the continuing struggle in people's daily lives, while Long Thanh's portraiture captures the essence of the Vietnamese people, especially his high-contrast pictures of old people who have witnessed more than their fair share of tradegy over the generations.

Must visit !
We liked -
The cable car crossing - 3.2 km log and high over the water to the island - cheap return tickets if not going into the theme park
We went over on a Monday - it was very quiet. The day before - Sunday was so busy we turned around, would have taken hours to just purchase tickets.
Lots of shops / eating places / night market etc

Avoid weekends - extremely busy, we chose a Monday to visit and it was not crowded
Its not Disney World but it is a fun place to go and experience.

Po Nagar Cham Towers - must-see place in Nha Trang but...
When we arrived at 10:00 in the morning, the area was overly packed with visitors. It opens to visitors at 8:00 am, so if you want to escape the lines, I suggest arriving early.

Nice when clean
When I arrived the sea was really dirty. They must have cleaned after my first couple of days here and it became a totally different place, hopefully, it stays this way. It's a pity about the kind of tourists it attracts (I literally saw a Chinese man pissing in the middle of the beach and another one throw his wrapper in the water).
Nice and pleasant beach when clean; I just wish the tourists who come here respected the sea (and the people around them) more.

Highly recommended, loved it
Really lovely waterfalls, well worth the effort. It is a bit of a hike so bring good walking shoes but so worth it and you dont need to be particularly athletic, there are just a few bits where your climbing over rocks but they have ample ropes and steps etc. highly recommended.

Another temple
Temple good to go to but in Asia on your tours that there are so many of them that you should limit them to one or two.
Thus one is impressive however.

Highly recommended
I had an unforgettable experience in Long Thanh Art Gallery. First of all it was a super hot sunny afternoon, once I get in, the photographer himself invites me in with AC and he instantly puts on his Jazz music, very chill and relaxing while I was enjoying his art work. He’s photographing is very impressive. Meanwhile he’s a very cool person, told me a lot of stories behind those photos. I highly recommend everyone to visit him and his art work in Nha Trang!

Very helpful people!
On the day of our arrival I purchased there 2 local sim cards.
And the excursion to the Zoclet beach was very nice!!!
I wish only Russian speaking people who come to buy excursions would learn how to wait when their turn is and would stop interrupting other clients when they are booking their excursions or inquiring for information.:)

Nice little peaceful beach
Nice little beach bay with interesting rock formation at one end. We found this beach nice and peaceful compared to further down the the coast, enjoyed many hours here with only 1 seller on the beach. Easy enough to cross the road and find food and drink options

Learnt something new.
A small but interesting museum. Most exhibits have text in English. Dr Alexandre Yersin appears to have been somewhat of a genius. He brought much to Vietnam, and you can see why they made him an honorary citizen. The way finding arrows could be improved so you view the exhibits in the correct order. As you walk in the door on the first floor the first exhibit is the chronology, it is directly in front of you on the internal wall. You move in an anti-clockwise direction around the internal wall exhibit. When you get back to the entry door you start on the exhibits on the external wall and move in anti-clockwise direction. You end up reading his will on the right hand side of the entry/exit door. It took us 1 hour to view the museum. It was 20, 000 VND per adult, well spent.

One of the best beaches in Vietnam
From my experience one of the best beaches in Vietnam. It is quite clean, lot of chairs and drinking options, there are still some people but it was not overcrowded. Spent there few days and evenings.

Pleasant day out in the sun.
Good long beach about an hours drive north of Nha Trang. We took the public bus from Nha Trang. Bus is air-con and a scenic drive along the coast. Beach was not busy and you can get inexpensive food. Nice breeze and good for swimming. Much quieter than the main beach in Nha Trang.
