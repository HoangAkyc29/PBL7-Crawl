Tour to Hue, Hoi An, Golden Bridge (Da Nang)
We visited those 3 beautiful cities for our honeymoon and Vu was our guide. His knowledge is excellent, he is really friendly and made us feel welcome, like we had a friend traveling with us. His tours are excellent, straight to the point and he explained us a lot of things about the history of the cities, their traditions, their religion and the culture of Vietnam. He also guided us to the markets showing us the daily routine of the locals, which is very important in order to understand the Vietnamese culture (we are from Greece so their culture was totally unknown to us). We are very lucky that we had Vu as we believe that without him we would have missed the chance to have so many details about the buildings, the cities, the culture etc. His tips about restaurants and how to spend our free time were really valuable. If you ever visit those cities, we strongly recommend to contact him as he will add value to your trip

Tour of Hoi An and Hue

We had the pleasure of spending a few days with Vu as our guide through Da Nang, Hoi An and Hue. Vu's local knowledge was excellent, articulate and always happy to answer questions and provided helpful advice along the way. Highly recommend talking to Vu if you're looking to visit Hoi An or surrounding areas.
Thanks again Vu!

Family (2 adults 2 teenager) Two day in HoiAn area
Aug 2018 • Family
Vu was our tour guide in Hoi An area. We had one day with a car visiting the Myson sanctuary and military museum in Hoi An, and one day we had a bike tour around Hoi An. Vu has deep knowledge of the area, history, religion and culture. He shared his knowledge with excellent communication skills in English and his attitude in these days made it a memorable experience we will cherish. Highly recommended.

Excellent food tour experience in Hoi An
Friendly & Interactive. We experienced the traditional food prepared by the local families at their home & also at eating joints that are a famous for their unique recipes introduced by their previous generations.
The tour was perfect for us, where we experimented with a lot of Vietnamese food items & especially some which are found only in Hoi An. Vu also made sure we know the story and history behind the food we tasted and relished.
Definitely worth it!
