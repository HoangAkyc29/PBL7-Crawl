Reasonable but quite touristy and commercial
Quite touristy and commercial. Make sure you head to the back of the main hotels in BaiChay to see where the locals eat, and get more authentic food. Worth a visit, but probably not somewhere to spend a whole heap of time.

Nothing that can’t be seen anywhere else
A small market focussed on tourists. Nothing special there but a good place if you want to buy a last minute souvenir or fake sportswear

Interesting activity!
After two days visiting Ha Noi my friend who traveled to Vietnam last year recommend Ha Long. It's seemed to be that I am the first traveler to book tour from Halong Bay Group Tours. We were picked up us from our hotel in Ha Noi then joined into one group of 30 other travelers who have the same trip. The tour included transportation from Ha Noi, cruise and food on Ha Long bay. Not bad full-day tour!
