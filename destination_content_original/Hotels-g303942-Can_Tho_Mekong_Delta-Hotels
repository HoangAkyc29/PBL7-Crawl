Mekong River CruiseCai - Rang Floating Market Tours - Touring a floating market in the Mekong Delta is a box that many travellers to Saigon wish to check, and none are bigger, or more popular than the Can Tho’s Cai Rang Floating Market.The Cai Rang Floating Market, the largest wholesale floating market in the Mekong Delta, starts around 04:00 and runs until 10:00, meaning that you’ll have to get an early start of the day if you want to visit.The market is about six kilometres from Can Tho, or about a 40-minute boat ride. While floating down the river, you get a glimpse of life along its shores. You’ll pass vibrantly painted boats anchored along the shore, merchant vessels carrying loads down the river and houses built on stilts over the water.Once you finally reach the market, it’s an impressive site. A stretch of boats selling all variety of goods lines the river.

Museum of Tarot
Museum of Tarot (in short term, or sometime Museum of Tarot and Oracle, or officially Museum of Tarot and Occult), founded in 2016 (will officially open in 2017), is located in Can Tho City, in the south of Vietnam. The museum has three themes: Tarology, Cartomancy and Occult. The museum has a large variety of objects from 15th century to 21th century. The museum is established in an ancient noble hotel, called “the citron house”, under the Vietnamese renaissance style. This house is sacrificed for the museum by an old couple of lawyer, Anh Ngo and Duong Ho in 2016.
