vietnam chicken rice
visited here last year when travelling to central vietnam in september.heard that chicken rice in da nang is famous,so called grab ride to here.there are one or two similar restaurants around here,i went to no 100.but it seemed that another A hai just beside it,the local said they are the same.quite confused.anyway i sat down,and ordered com ga quay,roasted chiken rice,it comes with sours and spicy cabbage, like kimchi, and soup. the rice colour is orange, maybe they cooked it with tomato or some kind of sauce.the taste is totally local,not heavy,the chicken is crispy,very nice.i noticed local people love to add chili sauce,so if you think the taste is bland,you can add sauce on it.there are three kind of chicken rice here.com ga quay means roasted chicken rice, com ga luoc, steamed chicken rice and com ga xe,shredded chicken rice. besides chicken rice,they have other dishes too.come here if you wanna try the local dish.next time i will try other chicken rice here.

Tasteless food
It was recommended to us by the hotel receptionist as being "the place" to eat traditional chicken with rice, but it was a dissapointment. Reaching the place we saw that local people eat there so we had high expectations. Unfortunately, the food was tasteless. ðŸ˜’

What a find.... 52k dong ($3 AUD) for a deliciously large roasted chicken and rice + side dish, sauce and soup. Great Bargain and very tasty...bring your own napkin to wipe your hands as they only provide paper.

Nice Roasted Chicken Rice
Stumbled upon this restaurant by chance and we weren't disappointed. The roasted chicken was crispy and the rice was delicious. For 52,000 VND I think it's value as the serving portion was good size.

Good chicken rice
Good fried chicken but not worth the hype. Donâ€™t get me wrong. The fried chicken here is good. But this place is not easy to locate as a tourist. Only if you are an expat, and you missed fried stuff, this might be one of your best choices.

Chicken Leg Rice!
We have tried the chicken leg rice there as it is close to our hotel. There is a place with many locals. Clean and large. Very good chicken leg rice in good price (48K). It provided menu with price clearly shown but in Vietnam language but it is easy to let the staff know your choice. Staff are friendly to travelers. A good choice in Danang both lunch or dinner if you like to eat chicken. Recommended.

Best chicken rice in Danang
This restaurant stretches down a busy street, so you can't miss it! It is usually busy with hungry people. The go to dish is the bbq crispy skinned chicken rice. One serving will set you back 48k VND or just under $3 AUD. The chicken is crunchy on the outside and the meat is juicy with perfect seasoning. The servings come with some pickled vegies, sweet chilli dipping sauce, a bowl of chive soup and orange chicken rice. The chicken rice itself is amazing and full of flavour. Definitely one of my favourite joints to eat at in Danang.
