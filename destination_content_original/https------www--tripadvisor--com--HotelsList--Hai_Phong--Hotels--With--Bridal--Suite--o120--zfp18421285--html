"The room was basic but clean. The family that runs the hotel is very friendly but doesn’t speak English. They never asked for our pasport. I had to pay cash, which is the only option in this hotel, but did not get..."
"We booked 3 nights here on booking.com but when we arrived we were told the hotel was full even though they knew we should be staying there. We were left in reception waiting for ages not knowing what was going..."

City View Hotel Haiphong
#98 of 320 hotels in Hai Phong
"I just needed a place to stay for one night before I went to the Halong bay cruise. The hotel is in a remote location of Haiphong. It is actually not that far from the city center, however, it felt like hundreds of..."

#56 of 144 hotels in Cat Ba
"I'm not sure if I should rate it 3 or 4 stars, it's something in the middle. I was there in winter so it's super easy to have a room at because there were not many tourists there. It located near the island center..."

#57 of 144 hotels in Cat Ba
"Warning. These people impersonate Cat Ba Vision tour company. I booked a tour at this hotel thinking it was Cat Ba Vision and paid extra money because the hotel staff claimed the boat crosses into Ha Long Bay unlike..."
"This is a lovely hotel in a great location with wonderful views.  There was just one little catch: there are public broadcast speakers on the street just outside that blared out who knows what at 6.20am on both..."

"The hotel represents quite good value but the Room is just sufficient for my needs. Interior is starting to age and the bathroom is really small. Specified non smoking room but first room was stank of stale smoke..."
"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights because the workshop I attended was held there. I had a suite, and the room was spacious and the bathroom had a bathtub. But the floor was not wood/tile, but carpet with a lot of..."

Du Commerce Hotel
#108 of 320 hotels in Hai Phong
"As at November 2009, Hotel Du Commerce appears to be no more. Redevelopment was going on, so it's possible that a replacement will be built. Alternatives (Monaco, Huu Nghi, Kim Thanh), are nearby."
"The hotel in Hanoi booked this hotel in Haiphong for us upon our request. It is located in a large colonial building just down the street from a museum. When we walked into the lobby in order to check in at the..."
Bach Dang Hotel

Thanh Cong Hotel

#3 of 8 hotels in Cat Ba Town
"The room we booked is a twin room. Although the receptionist said there was 02-way air conditioner, we could not use the hot mode. The meals were not as good as we expected and were not worth the prices."
"Negatives : The breakfast was the worst we have had in all of Vietnam, I don’t think they understand the importance of having a good breakfast We got locked out in the balcony because once it closes you can only..."
Do Son Resort
#111 of 320 hotels in Hai Phong
"The Doson resort is quite a way from anywhere (2 hours from Hanoi by car) and offers a casino as its main (and only) attraction along with a rather tatty and not especially attractive coastline. It is old and..."
"Vast area with big swimming pool. Refreshing to have morning walk / jog around the green surroundings. Service a bit slow if you are in a hurry. Room - no special décor but simple and pleasant. Can try your luck in..."

#114 of 320 hotels in Hai Phong
"If you visit Do Son with your big family with the reasonable budget, this hotel can be a suitable choice. It locates a bit far from the main beaches, thus if you have your own car it will be better for transport to..."
"This hotel is located in Do Son, but away from downtown (both Do Son and Hai Phong). Everything is quite run-down with poor maintenance. A room was run-down but stay-able, however, for VND 550,000, we felt it's..."

"Room looked ok but the beds had obviously not been cleaned since the last guests. Felt very dirty. Breakfast was very basic (bread, jam and option for eggs). Did the job for an overnight stay but I wouldn't choose..."

"We stayed here for 4 nights, room was nice but never cleaned. Not fair when not putting toilet paper in toilet. Had to ask for clean towels and toliet paper. Not a problem but staff had very limited English, got..."
"Our visit at the island was a two-day trip. Thanks God we stayed at this hotel only for one night! At the harbor we met our driver who, without any word, took us to the hotel. As a part of the tour we also had a..."

"This is the strangest place ever. Positive: The view. We stayed for one night (I don't wanna think about.) on the 6th floor and it was soooo creepy. We had a double room but many guests. Some were cute (geckos..."

"What a strange hotel. There was only 1 other guest when we first arrived although there were 80 rooms. It smelt fishy and musty and was quite a scary place. They turn all the corridor nights off at night. The..."

Hanoi
The charming Vietnamese capital has aged well, preserving the Old Quarter, monuments and colonial architecture, while making room for modern developments alongside. Hanoi may have shrugged off several former names, including Thang Long, or "ascending dragon," but it hasn't forgotten its past, as sites such as Ho Chi Minh's Mausoleum and Hoa Lo Prison attest. Lakes, parks, shady boulevards and more than 600 temples and pagodas add to the appeal of this city, which is easily explored by taxi.
