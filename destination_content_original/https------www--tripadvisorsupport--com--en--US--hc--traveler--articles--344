Owner Asking Traveler for Review Removal
Tripadvisor absolutely does not condone threats or bullying of reviewers, and you should contact us if this ever happens.

Review Publication Timing
Most reviews are posted within 24-48 hours. If a review is flagged by another user for a closer look, it can take several weeks to process, especially during our busiest seasons. As a free service to travelers, we do our best to manage publishing speed and quality. We base our decisions on what our members will find helpful and relevant.
