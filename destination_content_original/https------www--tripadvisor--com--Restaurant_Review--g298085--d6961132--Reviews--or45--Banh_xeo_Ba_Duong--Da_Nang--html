Perfect authentical food
We tried this place based on the advice from the travelers. It was so authentical place, but don't expect any fancy place. Food was perfect, I am not sure, if there is more to choose, but we took banh xeo. It was the best what I had in Vietnam. Be brave to go there. It is something like must to visit in Da Nang.

Amazing food hidden in an alley
This place was a bit difficult to find but it is defintely a hidden gem. They only offered 4 menu and we tried 3 of them. They're famous for their pancake but the real star was their pork satay. The meat was marinated well and was really juicy and tender, such a delish. Place was packed even at 3pm which was truly a sign of a good restaurants. Be aware of flies though but if you want an authentic local cuisine, this is definitely worth a visit.

Best Banh xeo in all of Vietnam!
Very busy restaurant that has only 6 things on the menu, we wanted to try Banh Xeo based on a food blogger's recommendation.. boy she was spot on. The whole experience of wrapping fresh ingredients, hot creps is great and the sauce is to die for! A real flavour explosion in your mouth, if in Da Nang do not miss this place.

Best Food Experience
Authentic and busy restaurant. Went with a food guide, and was a little skeptical walking down the alley.. What a fun time learning how to layer and wrap and the taste delicious. Now my favorite Vietnamese food, Just don’t expect anything fancy.

Great Place - Authentic
Went on Tuesday evening with two business colleagues. The place was very busy and we were the only non-locals it seemed. Very businesslike, certainly no silver service. Really good food, I would certainly return.

This is a must do eating adventure
If you get a buzz about eating local food with the locals this is a must.
You will make your own pancakes(rice paper of course) and have a great meal for a very low price.
Beware the location is not flash but its a local as you will find, Be Brave just do it

Overrated
You have to walked down the long narrow alley to get here. Walked in and place looks packed and loud. They just told us to go search for seats ourselves. We have to squeezed into a corner and it’s kinda tight with other people next to you with no elbow room. There was food and napkins thrown all about on the floor everywhere. Took us awhile For the staffs to acknowledge that we were waiting to order since we are about to passed out from hunger . We ordered 8 pieces of banh xeo and 10 pieces of the meat on the stick( come in 10 only) The meat on the stick was delicious . The banh xeo was overrated to me and it lack meat in there. And all the extra ingredients in it. The peanut sauce could have been better. Wish they can bring out the fish sauce and peanut sauce as options to dip. I wasn’t impressed by this place I noticed that’s it’s mostly tourist people from other countries and no locals. That tell you something cause you don’t see the locals eating there.

Not for the faint-hearted :)
Awesome food! Walk in, tell them number of people in your party, sit down, and food will be delivered to you. As far as I know, there's no real menu. They will bring out plates of Banh Xeo (Vietnamese pancake), grilled ground meat, fresh veggies, rice papers, and dipping sauce will be delivered to you within a minute. If you want drinks, you can walk up and get some from fridge in the back. Food was tasty and I got no stomach-ache from this place so for me, it was great! But my friends weren't too happy with the cleanliness of the place. Yes, servers seem to handle leftover rice papers with the same hand that handled the cash and rice papers were surely recycled. And house cat was walking all over the kitchen and the restaurant. But I really thought the food was great and only for $3.5, that's a bargain.
とっても美味しいバインセオとつくね団子、食べ放題な感じで飲み物含めて400円。生野菜たっぷり食べた後もお腹も壊さず大満足なんだけど、一緒に行った友達はローカルな店はもう結構とのことでした。

Must eat in Da Nang
My friend who frequently travels to Da Nang for work recommend this one for us and we are not disappointed!
The banh xeo are really special and tasty. The sauce just topped everything up. If you are not sure how to start, just look around and follow what other customers do.
We took a taxi to get directly from the hotel. The restaurant is down at the end of an alley. Just walk straight down. This restaurant is really famous among local and tourists so everyone will be able to point you the right direction.

Delicious
This was recommended by our local Airbnb hosts as the best banh xeo and indeed it was. It was extremely busy, packed full of locals and tourists whilst the adjacent banh xeo places were empty. We especially loved the beef. 10/10 for deliciousness.

Famous local food
This is not my first time to try banh xeo. But maybe this is danang style, the cake itself is thicker than what I ate in other cities. This is not my cup of tea.

probably danang's no.1 eatery
located deep inside a small alley and you have to walk further in to discover this eatery.
the shop was bustling with locals and tourists when we arrived around evening time.
- there is no menu for you. once you are seated, you will be served with their signature dishes.
- How to eat is the big question for tourist like us? you would probably be stumbled like us and watch how others savor their food before digging in.
Steps to eat
1. have a piece of rice paper rested on your palm
2. pick up a crispy pancake and place it on top of the rice paper.
3. add in the vegs
4. twist and turn the lemongrass pork skewer (in the middle of the pancake)
5. wrap the rice paper
6. dip into their special sauce.
7. EAT and repeat the steps above
cost for 2 pax with drinks is approx 135kvnd.
we left satisfied and both agreed this is one of the delight danang has to offer.
Cons
- don't expect hygiene level to be top notched.
- they seem to recycle the pork skewers if there are leftover from previous diners.

Believe the hype!
The bomb. That’s it. Eat slowly, figure out how to make the perfect bite for yourself. The standard way of eating this is to wrap the rice paper around the pancake and add other stuff. But that’s not the only way to eat it. Definitely recommend the basil beef as a side dish. And the skewers are awesome too. The pickled radish is very important, in my opinion.
I reckon the secret to the peanut sauce is minced pork and liver?

Delicious banh xeo in the middle of the city
This is is very high on the list of must try local food. The place is at the end of a small alley. The sign is big, you won't miss it. I think they only serve two items, banh xeo and pork skewer. One order consist of four banh xeo costs 50K vnd. Pork skewers come in group of five, 5K vnd per skewer. For two people, one order of banh xeo and two orders of skewers, plus two drinks, is about 130 vnd. The food is delicious. Wrap the banh Xeo and pork skewer in rice sheet and lecture, dip in the sauce. You won't regret!
