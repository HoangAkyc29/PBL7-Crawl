About
Discover the tunnels and grottoes within Thuy Son, the only one of the five Marble Mountains that’s open to travelers. Marvel at the Buddhist temples carved into the rock, then head to the hilltop overlook for awe-inspiring views of the city. Join a guided tour to learn more about the history of the mountains. To reach the summit, take the elevator or climb the stairs; if you choose to do the latter, be very careful as the marble steps tend to be slippery. Visit early in the morning or later in the day to escape the midday heat and beat the crowds. – Tripadvisor

Beautiful!
Everything is great here. I docked 1 point off the rating only because I think visitors should just prepare for being followed and asked to buy things. The people are friendly and kind but do follow you around if you speak English. It doesn’t overly bother me but I can see it being overwhelming for some. Wear non slip shoes as the steps are obviously very old and crumbling so you want non stick. The elevator up is very hot but only takes about 30 seconds to get up or down. There’s lots of places to buy water and souvenirs. You have to buy a ticket for entrance as well as a ticket to use the elevator up. There are steps to climb up however it can be challenging for anyone who isn’t sure footed. You can always take the elevator down. Ticket in per person is 40,000 dong and elevator is 15,000 dong up and buy another ticket to go down (total 30,000).

An unreal and divine experience
An experience that can't be put into words. 1. It's easy to reach from Da Nang about 15 mins scooty ride 2. The way up is via elevator as well through a cheap ticket 3. There are multiple caves but the one to not miss out on is the HUYEN KHONG cave. Feels absolutely unreal and there is an air which will just leave you at a standstill.

More like a theme park than a cultural attraction
I’m not sure I would recommend this place. Yes, the temples and caves are very cool. But it is crazy crowded, the signage is not great (the map we were given was sort of helpful but we still got lost more than once), and all the neon lights and souvenir stands make it feel more like a theme park than a cultural attraction. If you are staying in Da Nang or Hoi An and don’t have much time to sightsee and don’t mind the theme park atmosphere then you might have a good time, otherwise I’d recommend going to Hue or going to temples that are less commercialized.

Great experience even with a toddler.
A great experience with our 2.5yr old! Don't bring a pram though. And be prepared to carry your kid up and down a lot of stairs. But our kid enjoyed the experience and so did we. We didn't take the elevator, and the inital staircase was do-able. The stairs to the peak are what was challenging because it was steep!

Nice tourist trap
Not for everyone as some steps and caves are rocky steps of marble polished over time. At least one cave, most people chose not to go deeper because the steps are a little challenging.There was a lot of trash and junk,..even in a country known for it one would think more pride would be taken at an attraction like this, making it less beautiful. Overall, it was Ok for money, but note the large hell cave is separate admission. The area at the entrance has a tourist trap vibe and vendors will charge 5x more...they work it well and we're fun, to talk to so yes, we knowingly overpaid.,. For a souvenir with a story.

Sweaty awesome mess
Amazing adventure. The caves, lookout points, and atmosphere are not to be missed. You will sweat more than you ever have in your life. The stairs are tough to navigate - slick and uneven. Bring plenty of water and go early to beat the crowds.

Average and busy
This was our second trip here and we didn't enjoy it as much as the first time. The caves are cool to walk into and a nice respite from the heat but I wasn't a big fan of the windy small stairs to climb up and down especially as they are two way. It does feel like a little bit of a rip off getting charged for every bit separately, the cave, the Pagoda, the lift both ways, would prefer to pay one ticket price which covers you for everything. There are a few vendors to get drinks and ice cream along the way which was welcome in the heat. There was building work going on so it was quie noisy on the lower levels and you did get dust over you when you walked past to the high levels, feel like they could have put up on a dust sheet

A must see
This was an unexpected pleasant surprise. What they have done inside the mountains is amazing to see. The little stalls outside have some lovely gifts also. Must try the fresh coconuts, very refreshing. Make sure you waer comfortable shoes as the floor inside the cave can be slippy

mountains of five elements
Sep 2019
marble mountains also known as mountains of five elements: metal,wood,water,fire and earth.normally travellers only visit water mountain,there is a big glass lift there ,but it only take you to the half way of the mountain.i chose to climb by myself.inside there are many buddhist temple, statues, caves... the view on the top of the mountain is marvellous, worth the climb! outside or inside the mountain,there are some stalls and shops selling marble stone or items made of marble.i bought some small items inside the area,but not the marble stuff,just some glass stuffs,maybe next time will find some marble made souvenirs here.

We visited Marble Mountains as part of our journey from Hue to Hoi An. We didn't have high expectations but this place amazed us! It cost 35,000vnd each to enter the Marble Mountains and 15,000vnd each for the use of the lift each way. We chose to get the lift both ways but you could take the lift up and climb down if you had more time. Marble Mountains were beautiful and had so many hidden caves and beautiful ponds. Fantastic views from so high up.

Don't miss visiting this place!
Stunning caves here with opportunities to get absolutely beautiful pictures. You don't need to do a tour to get to this place. Either take an inexpensive taxi or the 6a bus for 5k. Cost to get in is 40k and another 20k for a separate cave by the entrance. Recommend doing both. Only 15k if you want to take the elevator up. There is still plenty of stairs and steps to do around the complex, so don't exhaust yourself in the beginning and maybe take the elevator. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see these caves and well worth it to especially do it inexpensively. Definitely recommend to go.

WORTH A VISIT......
Mar 2020 • Family
I suggest you get yourself here early morning or late afternoon, not like the crazy dogs and Englishman (my lot) out in the midday sun.
We drove (mum dad and 9 year old) here by motorbike from Da Nang, parked up in one of the shops outside and started off with the main cavern complex @ đ20,000.
Caved out, we took the lift @ about đ50,000 each (had I known it (and you want the exercise), you can use the steps for free).
At the top, there are a number of pagodas, gardens and two caves.
Altogether, it's a very nice place.
Take some water with you, as the sales ladies get a touch anxious if you refuse to buy their overpriced drinks.

Amazing carvings inside mountain caves
Feb 2020
It is quite amazing to see these huge budha carvings deep inside mountain caves. Wonder how they were made so many years back. The exquisite works done inside mountain caves, carving from the rocks is fascinating.

Very cool
It's a pretty tough walk to get up this mountain, but it's worth it. The river view is not impressive, but the religious caves and statues are fantastic... Hard to actually believe anyone could create them. Totally worth seeing

Good view of the various Buddha sculpture. As per display indicates, from the base. It will be 15,000 (elevator cost- up 1 way) + mountain entrance fees(40, 000). Once u are at the top, booth setup to charge for 1 way down elevator down to foot( 14, 000). But seriously, scenary is beautiful.

Breathe taking!
This place gave me goosebumps it was so beautiful. Inside the pagoda were monks chanting which echoed through the main area after the steep climb to the entrance. Make sure you wear suitable clothing as there are lots of steep stairs and caves to climb. Stunning views of the ocean and surrounds.
Could easily spend 2 hours going through from top to bottom.

Waste of money
Mar 2020 • Couples
A strange place atop a karst. Didnt actually see any marble. At the top of about 100 steps is about 5 pagodas and three small caves. Some annoyingly loud singing from some monks using microphones which they really didnt need. Cost an quite a lot too, 40 dong per adult, then 15 dong for the elevator up (and they dont tell you it's another 15 dong to get back down - scammers). There are some food shops at bottom and top, didnt eat or drink anything though. Viewpoints are ruined by constructions of new hotels. Wouldn't recommend visiting.

Interesting but steep climb to the top.
We called in here en route from Hoi An to Hue and found it more interesting than anticipated.

Primarily it's a series of caves, turned into places of worship, within one of the five marble mountains.
The climb to the top gets increasingly steep and more difficult. In the end, you're having to be reasonably agile or fit to get all the way up.
Views when you get there are probably worth it though as you look down on Da Nang, the beach and surrounding countryside.
I'd recommend if you're staying in Da Nang or passing through although I probably wouldn't make a special trip here.
