Gangneung
The sun rises just a bit more beautifully in Gangneung, particularly in nearby Jeongdongjin, where watching the dawn break on the South Korean horizon is an epic experience and a national New Year's pastime. The beaches and museums are splendid, and Gangneung’s unique parks are worthy of exploration. Kids will be awed by the submarine and warship at Tongil Park, while adults will go nuts for the dramatic architecture and contemporary works of Haslla Art World.

Larnaca
Swaying palms and a seaside promenade draw laid-back crowds to Larnaca—and its international airport means it’s the first stop for many visitors to Cyprus. Beyond the coast, sidewalk cafés, markets, and shops lend the port city a lived-in, local feel.
Luxor
The Luxor in Las Vegas is to the actual CITY of Luxor, Egypt, as marshmallow fluff is to fois gras. (We’re sure you knew that. We just enjoy analogies.) Sure, the hotel/casino in Vegas might have a beam of light visible from space, but we bet you'll find a hot-air balloon ride over the Valley of Kings much more illuminating. (Editor's note: Our list was compiled before political unrest prompted many countries to issue travel warnings for Egypt. If you're currently planning a trip to Egypt, please consider the risks and monitor your government's travel alerts.)
