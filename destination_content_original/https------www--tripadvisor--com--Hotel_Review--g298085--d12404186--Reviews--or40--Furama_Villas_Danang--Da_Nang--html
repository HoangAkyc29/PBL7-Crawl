My experiences with Butler Binh
I had the opportunity to use Furama's services, and I was blown away by how beautiful the villas were with their many trees, flowers, main pool, and gorgeous beaches. During my vacation, Butler Binh took care of my family. He was incredibly sweet and generous. Brother Binh, in my opinion, is Furama's best butler. Many thanks, Binh
