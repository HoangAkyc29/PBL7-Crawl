Địa điểm được xếp hạng là Di sản Thế giới được UNESCO công nhận, vẻ đẹp quá ấn tượng, như lạc vào một thế giới khác. Nghỉ 2 ngày 1 đêm mà cảm thấy chưa đủ, chắc chắn sẽ phải quay lại vào dịp gần nhất và đi chuyến dài ngày hơn trên vinh. Các hang động cũng rất đáng để tham quan.

Unforgettable trip to Halong Bay - chuyến đi chơi Hạ Long không thể nào quên

Halong Bay's beauty impressed my friends and me. Enjoying a meal on the cruise, seeing the bay, visiting caves make me unforgettable.
(Vẻ đẹp của Vịnh Hạ Long thực sự gây ấn tượng cho bạn bè và cả tôi nữa. Thưởng thức bữa ăn trên du thuyền, ngắm nhìn vịnh, tham quan những hang động khiến cho tôi không thể nào quên được).

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

For those who love sunrise and sunset…
Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

It is 2 days one night travel in haling bay, truly amazing and magnificent tour.

The view in haling bay is like in the paradise though I don’t know what the paradise really looks like but I do appreciate haling bay scenery. All is beautiful and definitely can forget all the worries.
Advised 2 days one night trip and can attend different activities such as the hiking, caves exploring and canoe, etc.
It is the place you must visit and I am so glad to visit here in the year of dragon..

Must see place
The bay is fabulous and sadly we did not even see it at its best as we had rain and mist! We spent a night in the bay on an Indochine Cruise boat which I would thoroughly recommend. It was a beautiful boat and meant we had longer there. Lucky to get a swim in the bay too off the boat.

Overnight stay on a Junk on Halong Bay
The Junk we stayed on was called The Victory.
It was clean and the staff were very friendly. Food they serve was very plentiful and good.
The bedrooms were compacted and had all you needed. The beds were very hard but for an overnight stay it wasn’t too bad.
The view of Halong bay is breath taking and would recommend to anyone to go there.
Went to the cave and went on a boat to see some of Halong. If you wanted to you could kayak.
Breath taking scenery.

Majestic even in lousy weather
Jan 2024 • Family
This was my second visit to Halong Bay.
First, in 2017 was in postcard like weather with blue skies and big heat.
This January visit was in a bad weather - rain, mist and chilly with only 13-14 'C. However, I enjoyed it very much and such weather even made a mystic and romantic feeling sailing through this worldwide unique nature wonder.
I think you cannot go wrong with any agency you choose. More or less their itinerary is pretty much the same, only the food options differ. So, just do it and enjoy.

To be amazed by the luxurious amenities and stunning landscapes on Le Theatre Cruises in Lan Ha Bay. The open-air decks provide the perfect vantage point to soak in the breathtaking views of ancient limestone karsts jutting out of the emerald waters.
