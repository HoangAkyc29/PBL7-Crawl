Review Publication Timing
Most reviews are posted within 24-48 hours. If a review is flagged by another user for a closer look, it can take several weeks to process, especially during our busiest seasons. As a free service to travelers, we do our best to manage publishing speed and quality. We base our decisions on what our members will find helpful and relevant.
Some reviews that take longer to appear on our site include content that falls outside our posting guidelines. For instance:
Personal attacks or language that is not family-friendly
Comments about other reviews or reviewers
Reviews that were submitted for the wrong place or airline
If we ever can't post your review, we'll notify you by e-mail and let you know the reason why. At that point, you may choose to resubmit your review, keeping our posting guidelines in mind.
