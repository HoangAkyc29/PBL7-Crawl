A must-try street food popular among local
Nice little street diner offering famous fried chicken rice. Packed with locals, this diner serves not very many choices but what they offer is certainly memorable! Plus, it's exceptionally cheap.

Tasty chicken rice!
We had a craving for chicken rice and found this place on the Trip Advisor so we decided to give it a go since its near to our hotel. At first we ended at the place where they prepared their food and we thought there was no place to sit and eat. Fortunately, we noticed the restaurant just across the road where there were many locals seated and eating. Although the staff don't understand English, they were very friendly and welcoming. The menu was in English so we were able to order quite easily. We ordered roasted chicken rice. It goes well with the local beer. The portions were generous and tasty. Our meal with the beer for 2 costs us 120,000 Vnd which we think is very reasonable.

Roasted Chicken for roasted chicken lovers
This place is by far my favorite place for chicken rice.
As I am a fan of roasted, grilled, fried...foods, this restaurant scores greatly for me with its amazingly well roasted chicken into just the way i like my chicken to be roasted.
I've been eating here at least once every 2 weeks since i first found out about this place.
They also serve other dishes but the best and most ordered must be roasted chicken wing/thigh with rice.
Highly recommend!

Good dish for dinner
It was the first food store I tried chicken rice in Đà Nẵng. The dish was generally delicious and was served with a small bowl of soup and kimchi. If you love chicken rice, this food store may be your choice.
