A view to kill for
The front line and restaurant employees went out of their way to accommodate our needs. The rooms are spacious with a great view. Great value for money, location is great and the infinity pool was the cherry on top.

Great location
We stayed here for 4 nights recently but through Airbnb and not directly with the hotel. The location is fantastic as it is right across from a beautiful beach and near many restaurants/food vendors. There are 3 restaurants onsite and an amazing roof top infinity pool overlooking the sea. There are a decent amount of chairs but no shade. All areas were very clean and we felt very safe. We will stay here again when in the area.

Great Location, but Nothing Special
Booking a family room for 2 nights. Maybe because my room is on the 6th floor, I could hear all the noise on the street all night long. If you book a room in this hotel, you better get a room in higher floors. Bathroom was small and no bath tub. Sink and countertop both were small. There was not enough space for my personal stuffs. People talked about the infinitive swimming pool. Besides the view, there‚Äôs nothing more to enjoy. Small and narrow, it is more for decoration than for swimming. Breakfast buffet was just ok. Same as other hotels in this area like donuts, cakes, croissants, breads, and some noodles. They provided same foods during my stay. Nothing special.

Dear Mr./ Ms. Dan N, Thank you for leaving a review for our hotel. We are sorry that you did not have a good time at the hotel. In terms of room types, there are currently only 2 types of rooms with bathtubs: Delight City and Delight Ocean. On websites, and booking apps, we already mentioned the bathtub in the description. As for the noise, if you've stayed at the hotel over the past weekend or June 30 - July 1, the music noise comes from the city's event held at the East Sea Park. We apologize for not taking this information when you made your reservation. Once again, √Ä La Carte Da Nang Beach sincerely apologizes to your family for the bad experience during this vacation. Hopefully, our apology can bring some comfort to you and your family. Best Regards, √Ä La Carte Team

Family holiday Danang
Had a great stay, was close to everything. Our Ocean view room was lovely, breakfast was good, cool roof top pool and the front office manager Nguyen was amazingly helpful and friendly. Only problem was the loud dance music coming from the Ocean lounge club across the road at night.

I would go again!
Great room and staff! Definitely could recommend this hotel. Nice clean and big hotel close to the beach. The sitting area was a great spot to hang out with friends before going out for dinner or a small trip.

Great hotel, great location.
We loved our stay here. It is in a fantastic location right across the road from the beach in the central area. It was a short walk to bats, beach clubs, massages, restaurants, cafes etc and there was a mini Mary just around the corner. The room was spacious and had all the amenities, including flannels and robes. The air-conditioning worked well. Breakfast was awesome with many tastes catered for and eggs how you like, cooked fresh. Our only negative was that there was no shade over the entire pool area. It would have been nice to lay on a lounge up on the roof top, near the pool, but it was too hot in the full sun. We changed cash at the front desk and got a good rate, however, as it was a long weekend we could only change $100 AUD each day (as the banks‚Ä¶

‚Ä¢ Stunning views from the infinity pool ‚Ä¢ Super friendly and helpful staff all around ‚Ä¢ Shout out to Ngoc, who is the lifeguard for recommendation for really good seafood close by ‚Ä¢ Room is of really good size and quality with a decent view ‚Ä¢ Only gripe is the lights in the bathroom were too dim, however it has strong water pressure with great drainage ‚Ä¢ Also, it would be good to have some crockery, utensils, and some washing up liquid ‚Ä¢ Beach is literally across the hotel ‚Ä¢ Great location and convenient with eateries, mini Marts, and beach bars within the vicinity ‚Ä¢ breakfast was good with a good mix of international & local cuisine
