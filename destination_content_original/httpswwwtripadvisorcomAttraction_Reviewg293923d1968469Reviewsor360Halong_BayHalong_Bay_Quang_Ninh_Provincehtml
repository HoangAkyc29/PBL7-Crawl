Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

For those who love sunrise and sunset…
Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Other wordly
Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Brilliant Halong Cruises arranged great cruise holiday family
Nov 2015 • Family
My family booked a deluxe cruise via Brilliant Halong Cruises website and they arranged a great cruise holiday for us in Halong Bay. We did tour of caves and see monkeys and our children loved these animals and kayaking was the best activity and cooking class was lovely as well. The chef also prepared vegan food for us. We loved this trip quite alot and would return one day.

Aclass Cruise in Vietnam cheat customers.
Dec 2014 • Couples

Halong Bay is an incredible, amazing experience, and rightly one of
the world's seven wonders.
But do not take Aclass Cruise. They cheat customers.
We had booked and paid Aclass Cruise for a deluxe cabin..And did not get it. .
We had booked and paid for to sail with A Class Cruise ship best,
Opera Cruises. And did not get it.
We had booked and paid for an Ocean View stateroom. And did not get it.
Instead we got a little cabin on Aclass Cruise worst ship. In our
cabin, 102, was a large hole above the door, so that it constantly
blew in, a toilet that ran all the time, cold breakfast, cold soup,
wine prices that were more than double the price in Hanoi and no
contact with Wi-Fi.
Aclass Cruises explanation was, that the company's best ship was
broken. We asked the guide to be transferred to another ship. He did
nothing. Was not helpful at all. We talked with a director of Aclass
Cruise. He did not care.
There can always be accidents with a ship. But it is when an accident
happens, that a company must prove what it is worth.
Here, the company did nothing. We, two people had paid $ 370 purchased
at Classic Street Hotel in Hanoi. We were offered a compensation of $
20. $ 20 for all that trouble and failure to comply with what we had
paid for.
It was a joke.
But do not take Aclass Cruise. They cheat customers. I would never
recommend others to use them.

Destroyed by tourism and locals
Jul 2015 • Couples
Very nice place though the water is being polluted day by day and will eventually be dangerous to swim in. You don't have to be a marine biologist to figure out how bad it is. I asked the tour guide where the waste goes and she said the ocean. I went canoeing around the bay and must have counted 50 plastic bags in the bay. Something needs to be done soon

Not worth a day trip
Jun 2015 • Friends
You only see about 20% of Ha Long Bay in a one day tour. Not worth the traveling to and from Hanoi to Ha Long which takes 8 hours on the mini bus on road with nothing scenic throughout the journey. Lunch provided whilst you cruise on boat from pier to the bay, nothing great. 40min self kayaking (included in day tour) or pay for boatman service to get closer to the mountains. Strongly recommend overnight of at least one night to have a meaningful trip.

A world heritage site for sure
Jun 2015 • Solo
I must say that I went off to this attraction with mixed emotions - given that there is not much evidence of conservation in Vietnam yet, I thought I may just be tripping off to another dirty attraction. This place is excellent - there are many tourist boats all doing the same round trip however there is plenty of room for all at this bay - it is massive and so beautiful. We had a storm on arrival at our overnight boat and even that could not dampen anyone's spirits - following lunch it was of to the caves and then a small beach or if you preferred a steep climb up to a massive lookout on one of the peaks. This is worth the effort and the views certainly reward you. This is a site well worth the time and trouble it takes to get there and the lodgings on our boat were first rate - and we were only on a three star boat.

Halong Dugong Sail operator - bed bugs
May 2015 • Solo
I just want to share my experience with Dugong sail operator. I was recommend at my hotel for 3D 2N cruise. First night on the boat and the second night on CAT BA , at a hotel. The first night on the boat, I was woken up by scratching a lot. And when I switch on the light, I was bitten all over from bed bugs. I show my tour guide as well the boat staff the bites all over my body.
The drinks are expensive on the boat but the lunch and dinner was amazing and feeling. The presentation on the boat was good.

Worth a Visit if in Hanoi
Feb 2015 • Couples
Don't be fooled by the beautiful pictures you see. In the dry season it is very misty (perhaps polluted) so the first impression is one of disappointment. The pictures are taken during summer when it is wet and extremely hot, and few people go there for that reason.
It is certainly a beautiful area and a 1 night cruise in a junk is good fun and you will see unusual and spectacular sights. There are many junks of all types and sizes and you should research carefully before making a choice to avoid disappointment.
The trip from Hanoi takes 3 hours and you need to do this in a car as there is a lot of traffic and other forms of transport would be unpleasant.

Halon Bay
Feb 2015 • Business
This is a beautiful part of Vietnam but there are a few things to consider: If you decide not to spend a night on the boat and make it a day trip then it becomes a very very long day. halong Bay is only about 150km from hanoi but it takes about 4 hours each way.
Secondly, if you visited Gvilin in Chaina, then there is a lot of similaritis ( eventhough Halong is much larger, it's a bay and gvillin is a river, but still...)
And the weather could get very tricky as well.

Royal Wings Cruise - Ha Long Bay
Jan 2015 • Friends
We had the most wonderful time on this cruise boat. Nothing could be faulted. The service was excellent. This brand new boat Is magnificent. The overnight stay and tour with Royal Wings cruise exceeded all our expectations. Lots of activities and the crew were great fun! Food was excellent and local produce. The Chef is very skilled and presentation of food superb!
Highly recommended and would love to go back again. We thought we had died and gone to heaven ;-)
Ha Long Bay and the caves are magnificent.
