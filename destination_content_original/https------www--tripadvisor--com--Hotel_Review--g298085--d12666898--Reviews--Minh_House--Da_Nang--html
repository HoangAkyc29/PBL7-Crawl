Minh House is the best in Da Nang!
Stopped in Da Nang at Minh House for one night - what a wonderful experience! Minh House staff (Vi and the rest of the team) were SO welcoming, attentive and go above and beyond for you. The room and hotel itself is stunning - modern, clean, beautiful. We both had a great, restful night sleep as the bed was huge and super comfortable. The breakfast was delicious and as soon as we entered the breakfast room, we were greeted with coffees, fruit and pastries and then a little later, our ordered breakfast. Minh House made our short stay in Da Nang perfect and we would recommend to all!

Warm hotel with kind staff, comfy rooms and close to the beach
The people working at the hotel couldn't be nicer, always friendly and attentive. The rooms were decorated with a modern touch, comfy beds, and with everything you need at a hotel. The pool was nice, and the breakfast was very good. Location was superb, close to the beach. Totally recommendable if you're spending a few days in Da Nang. ;)

Relaxing and cozy stay. Nice location, 10 min to the beach and 20 min walking to the expat district, where you can find nice reactants and cafes. You can also take a grap car for $ 2 Also lots of local food, that you can try on the surroundings. Also really quite with a beautiful pool

A nice place to stay
Stayed here for 8 nights in September. Very clean and friendly. The pool in the middle of the hotel was perfect. The room was plenty big enough and the shower had enough pressure. The ac worked well which was much appreciated. And the location was perfect. Close to the beach but not in the middle of everything. Would definitely go back.

Our last night was in Da Nang. Hotel in a quiet alley, good location very close to the beach. The staff are so friendly (Anh Tai), helpful, polite and very cute! The rooms are really clean and look beautiful with plenty of space. Overall an amazing hotel with value for money. MotorBike rental is perfect with very safe, good quality bikes.

My go to place to stay in Da Nang
Clean spacious rooms, Very nice indoor pool and outstanding staff make this my first choice when I look for Hotel in Da Nang. I work here once a month and have been staying here since it opened. Aunty Thu the cook always has a smile on her face and makes great breakfast. Thai and other front desk staff make the stay very enjoyable. It is a very easy quick walk to the beach and many restaurants close by also. Little Vin Mart is close now also.

Review on my stay from 18 Jan - 19 Jan 2020
My stay was pleasant. The staff in the hotel are very kind. The hotel is within walking distance to the beach. For breakfast, they offer local foods and western foods. Personally, I did like the local food "beef stew", which is translated as "bo kho" in Vietnamese, which I tried during my stay. For facilities, since the hotel doesn't have a lift, that might be problematic if you carry a large suitcase. So, this might be the thing that the hotel could improve. In short, I would recommend this hotel. Definitely, I would stay there if I visit Da Nang again.

Feels like meeting long time friends
Very welcoming staff at our first entry and during the whole stay. Felt like we were long time friends. Very nice and calm hotel, nice design of rooms. Bed very comfortable. In rooms during whole days relaxing music ( can be put off). Very near the DaNang beach. If you turn to left from hotel you will enter in a nice part of town, full of hotels, restos, coffeeshops and massage opportunities. But a 20 minutes walk away from the Dragon vridge and coty center. Breakfast very good and prepared by charming Ema who presented a daily varied breakfast. Reception staff very professional, interested and always ready to assist you. Special thanks to Mya, Nhi and Tina. Mya came back special from Minh boutique to say us goodbye. Hotel to be recommended to all ! Staff organised trip for usâ€¦
