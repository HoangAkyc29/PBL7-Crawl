Interesting activity!
After two days visiting Ha Noi my friend who traveled to Vietnam last year recommend Ha Long. It's seemed to be that I am the first traveler to book tour from Halong Bay Group Tours. We were picked up us from our hotel in Ha Noi then joined into one group of 30 other travelers who have the same trip. The tour included transportation from Ha Noi, cruise and food on Ha Long bay. Not bad full-day tour!

An excellent two nights on an Orchid Classic cruise in Halong Bay and beyond.
We chose Orchid Classic cruise and were werenâ€™t disappointed.From beginning with a pickup in a limousine van to leaving the boat everything was first class.The abundance of excellent food is to be remembered.The staff were lovely always smiling and serving us as though we were royalty.The bedrooms with big windows and balconies to get the fantastic views were immaculate.Very well organised especially the way the luggage was handled.I would recommend this cruise to anyone.There are so many different boats to choose from but we definitely chose correctly.
