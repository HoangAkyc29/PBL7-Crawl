Kì quan thiên nhiên
thg 6 năm 2016
Hạ Long một kỳ quan thiên nhiên. Du thuyền trên vịnh Hạ Long đã đưa mình đi tham quan các đảo và hang động trên vịnh. Đặc biệt mình rất ấn tượng với một số hang động trên vịnh nó rất là đẹp như hang Sửng Sốt, hang Đầu Gỗ.... Buổi tối mình còn được trải nghiệm câu cá và câu Mực trên vịnh. Vào bờ buổi tối mình còn đi xem nhạc nước rất là đẹp.

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

For those who love sunrise and sunset…
Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Other wordly
Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Tragic Halong Bay
Apr 2023 • Couples
We were so disappointed with our trip to Halong Bay, the town is half derelict when you arrive and the boats look really shabby. But it gets a whole lot worse when you go out into the bay, it’s filthy! Plastic and rubbish floating everywhere and sewage and oil for the many many boats. The activities were awful, crowded and badly run. I’ve never been anywhere so depressing, dont believe the beautiful pictures you see, it must have been gorgeous once but is in a disgusting state now. UNESCO and the Vietnam government need to clean it up soon or it will be ruined forever. A real shame.

Beautiful Halong Bay

We did this visit as part of our holiday with Mercury Holidays - Impressions of Vietnam.

Excellent trip. Rooms were lovely, bathroom ideal. Food was excellent. Views brilliant. Would definitely recommend it.
We visited the Luon caves in a bamboo boat and also went to a beach for a swim. Did Tai Chi and engaged in a cooking demonstration
Staff very helpful. Drinks available - card or cash.
Beautiful area. Very calming atmosphere and beautiful views.
Quite alot of rubbish but I believe the Government are looking at getting the Boat Owners involved in clearing it up.

Worst part of Vietnam trip
Mar 2023
I can only reiterate what previous reviewers have said. Halong Bay is absolutely filthy and we were unable to swim in the water, and even avoided kayaking. We stayed on a wonderful cruise boat, Heritage Ylang, which took us around Cat Ba Island which was supposedly a quieter area. It was not quiet at all and I hate to think what the busier part of the Bay was like. Would not recommend to anyone at present.

A stunningly beautiful bay but rapidly becoming full of pollution.
Jan 2024 • Friends
Visited whilst on a cruise and Halong Bay really is very beautiful. You'll notice that the water is polluted and I can't imagine that anybody would ever want to swim in it. A short boat tour around the bay and a stop off at a market selling tourist trinkets was about enough for us in such heat and humidity. Take a hat and cover yourself with sun cream.

It is 2 days one night travel in haling bay, truly amazing and magnificent tour.
The view in haling bay is like in the paradise though I don’t know what the paradise really looks like but I do appreciate haling bay scenery. All is beautiful and definitely can forget all the worries.
Advised 2 days one night trip and can attend different activities such as the hiking, caves exploring and canoe, etc.
It is the place you must visit and I am so glad to visit here in the year of dragon..

A night in Ha Long Bay
Nov 2022 • Friends
Magnificent views. And Nature in all glory. The beautiful cruise surrounded by nature. Then go on a boat to sung sot caves , followed by climbing to the caves ( only for the strong hearted ). Then lo and behold the wonderful sights in the cave. Then a small boat ride to Tito beach. Fun and frolic there. Boat ride back to the main boat. Then Sunset watch if you are lucky !.
A night of peace and tranquility in the anchored Big Boat, surrounded by the hills. A beautiful sunrise reflected in the seas.
Then a small boat ride . And an opportunity for the daring to go kayaking . And for others go through the surprise cave and surrounded by hills all round . And then Monkey watch and the antics of the smart ones.
Well all good things have to end : Ride back in the Small boat ,to the mother boat and then cruise back to the pier.
Unmissable !
