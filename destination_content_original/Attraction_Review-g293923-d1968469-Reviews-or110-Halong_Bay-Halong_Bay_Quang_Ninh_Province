Tôi rất thích cảm giác khi đi tàu ngắm cảnh trên vịnh, gió, bầu trời, những hòn đảo, chim biển và các con tàu,... tất cả đều rất tuyệt.
Xuống tàu rồi lại muốn đi thêm lần nữa!

Lâu rồi không xuống tàu đi chơi vịnh, giờ thấy nhiều cái khác quá.

Cảnh đẹp vẫn tuyệt vời như xưa, không khí của vịnh đã hít một lần là muốn hít nữa, nhất là với những ai sinh sống và làm việc ở các khu đô thị. Giá mà Ban Quản lý vịnh đẩy mạnh hơn nữa hoạt động bảo vệ, tôn tạo môi trường vịnh để "sea life" phát triển thì tốt.
Dịch vụ tàu ngủ thì khác nhiều. Tàu đẹp, phòng đẹp và tiện nghi, đồ ăn ngon, hấp dẫn, nhân viên thân thiện.

là nơi đẹp để đi nhưng nhìn chung hải sản tại đây lại không hề rẻ
thg 12 năm 2016
tôi thường du lịch tại Vịnh Hạ Long vào mùa hè. Đây là một nơi có cảnh quan thiên nhiên vô cùng đẹp. Tôi thích cảm giác nằm trên boong tàu ngắm hoàng hôn. Các hang động đẹp, bí ẩn, Đồ ăn tại đây cũng như ở Hà nội, không rẻ hơn. Tuy nhiên sẽ vẫn là nơi đáng để đi nếu bạn ở Hà Nội và muốn thăm quan biển mà không có nhiều thời gian để đi xa. Dù sao với tôi, Cát bà vẫn thú vị hơn mặc dù 2 địa điểm đó không cách quá xa nhau

Tôi đến Vịnh Hạ Long vào tháng 10, thời gian này thường ít người tới du lịch nên rất yên tĩnh. Còn gì tuyệt hơn khi đến TiTop Island để chơi đùa trên bãi tắm và ngắm hoàng hôn và thức dậy trên du thuyền với những tia nắng lọt vào khoang. Buổi chiều cũng có thể chèo thuyền Kayak quanh vịnh.

Howard’s visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Best place to go if you love to watch sunrise and sunset. By taking the cruise you will get the experience to watch it closely. Just make sure you bring small amounts of cash as everywhere you go, they will asked you for a tips… 🤭🤭🤭…

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Ha Long Bay’s natural beauty is beyond words, and this trip offered breathtaking views of the islands. Cruising through the landscapes was an enchanting experience, and the photo opportunities were endless. The caves were fascinating to explore, and the kayaking, though brief, was enjoyable.

Lovely place to visit, amazing views and history of the islands. A cruise for 1 or 2 nights is highly recommend.
Only 1 downfall which with time and help from people changing attitude, is the rubbish floating. It is improving but you still see alot.

PARADISE AT RISK

Extraordinary place that will not leave you indifferent. Went on a cruise for 2 nights and the scenery was breathtaking at any given time. Kayaking, far from the big boats, and exploring by yourself is a unique experience.
My only constructive critique is the amount of plastic, floating or not, that you will see. Unfortunately this will not leave you indifferent either. Local authorities should put attention to this problem that may be close to be out of control (if not yet).

This is one of the most beautiful places on the planet. Take a day tour or spend a few days on a boat cruising the 1000’s of islands. I have been to many places around the world and the natural beauty of this place is truly mind blowing. WOW- definitely a place to come and spend some time. Took a cruise around the island for the day and had wonderful time. Tour the city as well and many things to do. Don’t miss this place.
