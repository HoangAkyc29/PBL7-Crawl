Howard‚Äôs visit to Halong Bay, Vietnam.
Did a boat trip to Halong bay to sail around the limestone outcrops. Stunning views after about 20 minutes, visited a cave system on one of the islands, lots of steps to get there but worth it. Continued the sail around numerous islands, then as the sun was setting amazing sunsets.

Yes it is as stunning as people say, even if at times you struggle to get a view without one of the many boats. A lovely, relaxing respite from the hustle and bustle of the usual Vietnam tourist trail. And photos definitely don't do it justice. Just don't look down..........as the water pollution is pretty depressing. Plastic bags and bottles, food waste etc which can only come from the cruise boats. We went kayaking but got out after about 15 mins as we found it so unpleasant. So surprised the authorities and cruise companies don't take more responsibility to safeguard this natural beauty and their livelihoods.

Alisa Premium Cruise Halong Bay
We took the 2 days 1 night Alisa Premium Cruise to Halong Bay in April 2023. It was an enjoyable trip with my family. A big thank you to Nelly Pham, Operation Manager. Nelly has arranged everything for us before our arrival, from transfer to the cruise and the itinerary during the cruise. Nelly is very efficient and responded to my messages via WhatsApp very quickly. It was a most memorable trip for our first time in Hanoi.

A magnificent destination in Vietnam
Its limestone islands are a sight to behold, and the stunning scenery is truly captivating. The fascinating history of the bay and its surrounding area is well worth exploring, and the delicious seafood is a must try. It's a great place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. The kayaking and boat trips are a great way to explore the area, and the caves and grottos are a must-see. There are plenty of activities to do in the area, and the locals are friendly and welcoming. Halong Bay is an incredible place to visit, and it's a must-see for anyone looking for a unique and unforgettable experience.

I found this travel agency online and contacted Ms Hana, she responded me right away and answered all my worries, concerned about my trips. We chose package 6days 5 nights Hanoi, Halongbay, Sapa with very good price. When we arrived, the tour guide and driver picked us up at the airport and went to hotel to check in, everything was very smooth. Hana was always ready to help and support us everyday when we were in the trip. Highly recommend Vietnam Authentic Holidays and Hana, for sure I will book her my next trip to the center of Vietnam next year

A must-see destination in Vietnam
With its majestic limestone karsts and emerald waters, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular tourist spots in the country. Luxurious cruises offer the perfect way to explore the bay and its incredible rock formations. The views are simply breathtaking and you can even take a kayak to get up close and personal with the scenery. The crew on board are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable and will make sure you have the best experience possible. Whether you're looking for a romantic getaway or a family holiday, Halong Bay has something for everyone. Don't miss out on this incredible destination!

Should take an overnight cruise at this unusual bay.
The karst formations that stick up like pillars out of the water are a must see in Vietnam. It is picturesque from a distance, but would not like to swim or use the few beaches due to horrendous pollution here. We went in the off season, but July and August would have even more boats and tourists. The plastics and rubbish floating, and around the shore at the high water mark is disgusting. Some regulations need to be put in place before the bay becomes totally unnavigatable.

Sailing in the paradise
We visited Hanoi on a SE Asia trip and fall in love with this place. It is about 2h away from the town and then you board a boat. There are many options, many of them are good for overnight trips. The went for a day trip and had the change to sail between the beautiful islands and islets. Great experience. It was about 80AUD per head. Highly recommended.

Overhyped, overcrowded, and polluted
Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples
We did a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù 2-day cruise around Halong Bay, Lan Ha Bay and the Cat Ba island. It was pretty expensive for what you actually get. In reality, it‚Äôs only a 24-hr cruise, not 2 days, and we spent more on 1-night cruise than on all of our accommodation in Vietnam for 3-weeks we were there. Was it worth it?! Definitely not!!!

Halong Bay is not as pretty as you see in magazines - photos that are heavily edited to make it look amazing. The place is overcrowded by tourists, as a result it is extremely polluted. There are plastic bags floating in the water, and a permanent smog surrounds the mountains preventing any clear views. No, it‚Äôs not clouds, it‚Äôs pollution from all of the boats around the area. I was unpleasantly surprised by how polluted this place was as I was expecting a natural beauty (which was undoubtedly there maybe 10-20 years ago but is now being destroyed by excessive tourism).
If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn‚Äôt.
If you, however, want a great alternative to Halong Bay, authentic and uncrowded beauty with equally impressive limestone cliffs, then you should head to Ninh Binh or Phong Nha - the places that still retain a lot of charm and authenticity of Vietnam. I wish someone would have advised me against coming to Halong Bay as I would have gladly extended my stays in both aforementioned places or gone to Sapa.
If you are desperate to see it, then go to Cat Ba island and book a tour from there. It will be much cheaper, and the bay around that area is much quieter.
The problem with overnight cruises is that they are super expensive for a relatively average experience. The rooms are nice, but would we really pay several hundreds of dollars for a nice hotel room for one night in Vietnam, where we were able to get a lovely room (of the same standard) in the center of Hanoi old town for $25?! Even 5-star cruises are still tourist factories - they get you in, they get you out as quickly as possible, because they are readying the boat for new guests the next day. There is no personalised experience that many of them claim they offer.
If you want a truly magnificent views with limestone cliffs and crystal clear waters - go to Coron Town or El Nido in Philippines instead. Now that‚Äôs a view I will never forget!

Pollution is overwhelming
Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples
While in Vietnam we did the obligatory visit to Halong Bay. Yuk!
We flew to Halong Bay by SeaPlane which was the best part of the trip, simply because you get to view the enormity of the bay and pinnacles.
But the air and water pollution are so bad that it ends up being a trip to view how a Country can contaminate and ruin a natural wonder.
We were dropped at a beach to go for a swim..... but I‚Äôm not keen on swimming with babies nappies, sanitary pads and condoms not to mention the festering scum that floats on top of the water.
The air is so thick with pollution that if you suffer with a respiratory issue ie. asthma..... then be careful. The guides try to make out it‚Äôs a sea haze, just like they do in China. But the funny part is that, just like in China the sky starts to clear in patches by Sunday afternoon. One guide even tried telling us that it was China‚Äôs pollution not theirs.
I‚Äôve travelled extensively and can tell you that you can get better scenery than this in Thailand, off Phuket there are an enclave of pinnacle islands. The water is pristine, the air is clear, no pollution, the beaches are golden - no rubbish, you can see the sun, stars and the moon. We stayed at the island of Ko Yao Noi, Thailand and there was no comparison.
If your travel money is tight, do yourself a favour and compare. Or just look at my photos and know that this is what Halong Bay really looks like.... Grey, Dull and Polluted.

Well worth it!
Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family
Alot of reviews mentioned that Ha Long Bay needs to be enjoyed by staying overnight. However due to time constraints I did a full day trip from 730 am till about 930 pm. It sounded long and tiring but with our exceptional tour guide Kien from the newly formed Dragon King Travel, we enjoyed every single minute of it. The coach is very new with wifi and charging ports and as it drives past the different provinces Kien talks about their culture. He is able to get our group to mingle around and we had a relaxing time cruising the bay, eating and drinking and making new friends. This company goes on the longer route to see Surprising Cave ( the biggest). We get to kayak around an enclave and climb Ti top mountain to have a panoramic view of the bay. As we cruise into the sunset we are even served red wine! Go to Dragon King Travel Facebook page to ask them for their price so you will bypass the numerous travel agents in Hanoi.

Crap, don't go here and waste yime
Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples
We got a public bus from Hanoi to halong and originally booked for 2 nights in a apart-hotel. It was terrible so changed tona hotel at the marina bay. It was decent (golden gem hotel) would advise staying there but would advise against halong in general as the city is the worst place I've ever been to. Opinion all the same from the 3 other people I went there with! We cancelled our 2nd night there - we couldn't find a decent restaurant to eat in and it was pretty much like a ghost town trying their best to become big which wasn't working out quite well for them. It's a pity as the people there are making an effort!
We got the boat trip the next day which was meant to be 4 hour long and ended up being 2 hour, much to our delight as it wasn't great anyway. The views weren't anything special that I haven't already seen before. Wouldn't waste time and energy going there! A lot of boats apparently sink there too which made us feel uneasy and the water is disgusting! Please please don't go there!!

Polluted.
Jun 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples
We did a 2 day, 1 night tour of Halong Bay. We wasn't sure on going here as we thought it would be polluted and busy with tourist boats but we thought we should just because it is a UNESCO world heritage site and it would be a shame to come all the way to Vietnam and skip it.
It is an incredible place, There is no denying, however our thoughts on why we should have skipped it were true. It is completely ruined with waste, plastics, packing foam and so on and after visiting the Philippines we couldnt help compare the two places. The Philippines is absolutely beautiful and Halong Bay just wasn't. There are too many boats on the waters pumping out black smoke into the air and Its disgusting.
We stopped at a lagoon to kayak and ended up litter picking because there was so much plastic floating around. When we took the kayak back the guys running the kayaking just pushed the boat back out with the others and left the pile of rubbish on the boat. Real nice.
The Vietnamese have a total disregard for their environment and you will see this when/If you come here. Such a shame.

Polluted Bay
Aug 2016
We stayed 4 nights on Cat Ba Island which is part of a chain of 366 islands that lie within the larger area of Ha Long bay.
Famous for stunning natural beauty it was officially recognized as a World Biosphere Reserve
It attracts millions of visitors from around the world.
However, it is cluttered with litter everywhere - Yes everywhere and I have never swam / canoed in open seas (and snorkel) where there are no fishes. None.
The whole area is over fished and much worse - grossly polluted.
Unbelievable disgrace, a disaster of Global proportions and the Vietnamese peoples should be very ashamed!
Action needs to be taken urgently to recover and then preserve this natural beauty.

Disrespect to the environment!
Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Couples
It is a pity to see one of the natural wonders of the world so polluted and unprotected by the government.
There are lots of plastic bags, plastic bottles and other kind of rubbish floating in the water. Imagine kayaking or swimming in such a water! When you go for a visit to a Cave or an island, it is full of garbage too: plastic bottles everywhere, different kind of food waste.
It seems that the government doesn't care in taking any action to protect or at least clean the area! It is just a source of money.
I think places like that should be avoided by tourists as sign of protest for a disrespect to the environment. Never again!

Ha Long Bay-What are Must See? Must Do? What to skip?
Jan 2015 ‚Ä¢ Couples
Must see, must do‚ÄîJunk Boat tour. I would do 2 nights. The reasons are:
1) Fog is prevalent in the Bay. Fortunately, the fog lifted during the afternoon on our first day. Our breath was taken away by the sheer beauty of this natural wonder. We watched sunset. Not so lucky on our second day. Fog covered the beauty most of the second day. We met tourists who chose 1-night package. They never saw the beauty we did. 2-nights package provided one extra daylight opportunity to see and be in awe of the beauty.
2) The 2-night tour also includes a kayak tour, which I think for me is the most memorable and enjoyable part of this tour. Why this is worth the trip alone? We were able to enter parts of the bay only allowed by kayaks; which means no Junk Boats, no rusty tankers, no house boats, and significantly-reduced debris. My most favorite part is this tiny tiny bay, reachable only through these tunnels, formed by these magnificent limestone islands. This tiny bay was serene, perfectly still. The water is clear, and vibrant emerald. The sky, the surrounding islands harmoniously blend to a perfect painting imprinted in my mind forever. At the bay, I was able to go beyond intellectually what it means to be connected to heaven, earth. I was able to be immersed into this beauty, nature, all blended into one. This is what the trip experience is about. This is what life is about.
3) Third reason is two-day tour include a visit to the cave. This natural formation is a wonder to see. The vastness of the cave is deceiving from the outside. The crowd is something to get used to. But it is definitely worth a visit.
Just in case you wonder about 3 nights or more as I did, it was not recommended or encouraged. The junk boats and tour guide just recycle the same route, same itinerary, same activities, same performances, same food.
Bring a light jacket, a scarf for evening chill. We were there in January, and the jackets & scarves were needed. Hat, swim wear, water shoes, walking shoes (for the cave), sunglasses, all come in handy.
What to Skip:
I would skip swimming in the Bay. Even though the tour guides encourage jumping into this gorgeous emerald water, I would think twice. Swimming may be a wonderful idea 10-15 years ago. If you pay attention to the activities on the water, by the junk boats, by the tankers, by the locals who live full-time on their boats, you may come to the same conclusion. The lack of environmental awareness and weak enforcement to protect this precious bay gave me plenty of reasons to skip swimming.
If you are travelling without a driver or a guide, I would skip most of the ‚Äúmanufacturers‚Äù or ‚Äúfarms‚Äù unless you need a washroom break. I was told the tour drivers must have at least one break. And the drivers usually stop at one of these factories. It serves 2 purposes: 1 is the drivers get fed at these facilities. The second purpose is to have their passengers make some purchases. As in everywhere in Vietnam, price is negotiable, even if they tell you no. I don‚Äôt mean to be prejudice or to offend anyone. The truth is if your outer appearance is westerner, (fair skin, blond hair), the asking price tend to be much higher. Value is in the eye of the beholder. Just ‚Äúbuyer beware. ‚Äú
One final personal note:
Ha Long Bay, don‚Äôt expect perfection, as shown in many tourist pictures. The thousands of limestone islands sprinkled around this emerald water are real. Junk boats are also real. However, what is not revealed is the number of junk boats scattered around the Bay.
For me, the most disturbing part of the Ha Long Bay is the lack of respect for this precious precious nature! Debris such as plastic bottles, foam items, houseware, even life jackets, scattered throughout this beautiful emerald water. I was told by our junk boat guide, the government does hire local boaters to collect garbage off the water. Not enough of them.
Coming from beautiful BC where natural environment is so sacred, and precious, and fervently protected, I was horrified!
In addition to the debris, it was also impossible to ignore huge rusty tankers in the midst of this amazing vast beauty! We could get close to one tanker and observed black materials (coal?) being loaded onto primitive tiny row boats, operated by single individuals. I assume it is to transport to shore? I saw no patrols, no monitoring, of any sort.
Having said all that, Yes, Ha Long Bay is definitely worth experiencing. There are many tour / junk boat operators. I suggest to go with 4 star & up.
Background: Husband and wife in 50's -60's. Wife who does not swim, loved the kayaking, as mentioned in the review. Don't miss it!

Jul 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family
Dirty water, mediocre outcrop view, just like Patong in Thailand, thanks to the tour agency put us on a cruise taking use to jetty terminal area of Cat Ba island instead of the more popular mooring site. See photos. I am sure there are prettier area of Halong bay based on experience from friends and online review so beware when you book your trip.

Dirty water Period
We had a 3d 2N cruise here in Halong Bay before we went to the cave ( i forgot the name of the cave)
It looks the same as the one as you see in the post cards but if you look closely to the water you can notice how dirty it is. The water were tons of tourists jump in to have a dip. I noticed lots of cartons and trash floating near are cruise ship
The mountains were amazing. but the Bay itself is actually disappointing.
not worth the trip
