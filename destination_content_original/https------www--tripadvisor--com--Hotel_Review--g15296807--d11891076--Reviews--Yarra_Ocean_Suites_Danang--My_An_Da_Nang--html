Lovely view and location..
The hotel's location is the best as this one is the last in the row and has vast front and side view of the sea and the city. Pls see pics... We stayed in Superior delux room having all the necessary room amenities and crispy white bed and bathroom linen and comfortable bed. We found the Hotel bit dated but maintained..ambience too was uninviting especially the lobby may be due to off season . All the staff were very courteous, well mannered and helpful. Breakfast options were not many for vegetarians..No cappuccino...we managed with fruits and bakery items. Room cleaning was little disappointing..we notified the manager about that and they followed.. The hotel has roof top pool with sitting area, gym and spa. Main thing was the atmosphere outside the hotel...which was‚Ä¶

Good location
The hotel has great service and really appreciated the free upgrade with sea view. The breakfast buffet is a great with a wide selections. However, can really focus on the smaller details as it is a 4 star hotel. The carpets can have a scent that needs attention, including the small gym has equipment that needs repairing.

Very good
I stayed for three days and the ocean view was so pretty and the breakfast was so great. I want to come back. Very satisfied. I'm going to visit again with my family later. I wish I could stay at the rooftop swimming pool later. I think I'll come with my parents later

Adorable sea view!!!
What a adorable sea view hotel!! I can see the beach every morning I woke up, so love it. The staff is hospitable and really helpful, let's ask Thao and she and others will tell you many places for visiting. Many minimarts and pharmacies in this area. The weather in Danang is nice also. I had gone to Linh Ung pagoda that's on the Son Tra peninsula.
